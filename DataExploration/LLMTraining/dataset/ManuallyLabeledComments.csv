the problem is multi dimensional each of the cause you have mentioned contributes equally to the pollution i don t think any one single government can handle it however you have left one important thing while explaining what cause the smog the most important factor that no human or government can change is the atmospheric inversion that set in inversion creates a blanket effect usually atmospheric inversion take place on the onset of winter and diwali always follows inversion by three to four day when an inversion take place all pollution get trapped other problem are highly concentrated population in fertile plain since almost of the world population resides here any type of consumption will always lead to high emission farming is another problem though north indian state have been converted to rice producing state but it s not beneficial for u to change the current farming practice government requires huge amount of investment punjab can t really afford to go along with this a it ha a very high debt already this is just a glimpse into the problem but to tackle this problem is not going to be easy there is not one solution and need a tremendous change from behaviour of people to financial government would want to go down that black hole on top of that our administrator ia are not capable of solving problem they can delegate or remove the problem from sight but they don t have the skill to solve it someday i would like to discus the problem farther it s not going to be solved in next five year at least,Government / Population,Negative

kudos to banerjee bro for bringing on the correct figure on which state is most responsible and which government is most you still did acknowledge elephant in the are the human burning these are the same farmer who we tagged a ann data during farm protest and made super human out of them for their own greed they burn parali so they can quickly sow the next crop it ha nothing to do with ann data part just like every businessman they are doing their because people like you and other politician who did question their wrong doings during farm law protest gave them the belief that they are above law and can do anything but tagging it a done by ann data few day back few government official in punjab went to these parli burning site and asked farmer to stop it rather the farmer forced them to burn the crop that the kind of frankenstein you created because you were bugged by the concept of opposing government and am all in your support if you doe it for valid reason but doing such thing and letting these monster creation is helping the had it been bjp in punjab i know you would have created a whole episode for there are alot of suggestion which the state government can follow to curb these but it requires fund the punjab government ha fund for freebie and not for these reform because freebie generate more vote then the reform ending my view by saying no banning idea will reduce the aqi index be it jumla like odd and even or ban firecracker untill and unless nature come to our rescue unless there are strong wind which take away the smog away from ncr or rain which brings the smog down this happens every year and once the aqi will improve the government will give sabashi to themself for taking effective decision like odd even and firecracker ban which improved aqi state government need to take strong step to curb crop residue burning and that will agitate the farmer and then politician and intellectual will join them in these agitation of ann data to oppose the government what and irony for this nation,Government / Stubble Burning / Firecrackers,Negative

absolutely right a usual grew up an asthmatic in india sometimes went out shouting on road on diwali night asking people to stop no one want to accept that pollution is a cumulative effect of all of the factor and we ca just pick and choose and point in the other direction to avoid having to make sacrifice,Firecrackers,Negative
there is no doubt that pollution should be controlled and measure to reduce burning farm residue should be provided to farmer but underlying problem is the paddy cycle changed in past few year which is causing multiple issue water scarcity power scarcity and air pollution crop residual burning used to happen earlier a well but the timing wa different at that because paddy crop cycle wa atleast 4 earlier than the current cycle this problem need to be addressed at grass root level when government and people would come together to work on this otherwise keep banning cracker keep banning car and continue this political shitshow this will never end,Stubble burning / Farming practices,Negative
keeping everything aside they should work on increasing the percentage of ethanol blending and ethanol can be produced from parali itself the pace of work in this direction is very slow and yeah you are mentioning correctly people do care about taking control of this serious problem year after year this problem arrives and yet most people think it in way that it no big deal bursting cracker on diwali is still an issue we have to control a little on that we are not in 90 where we can burst any cracker we want of course pollution wa there even before diwali a well because of stagnant air that usually develops in winter but just a day before diwali we had some rainfall that literally brought aqi from very severe to severe level from vheicular perspective scheme did play a slight role in lowering the pollution but thats a fraction of full remedy actually govt should change all public transport from dtc bus to auto rickshaw to electric vehicle i did witnessed that slowly they are doing that but they should increase their pace in this direction and if possible they should promote usage of electric vehicle even more should provide subsidy on anyone who opts buy an electric car and may be some other perk a from all these thing i personally used to follow a practice that on my birthday i used to plant a tree in different park or in area that are covered with tree of delhi so if anyone think that this practice is good then they can follow it a well sitting and blaming the government is not the only thing we can do a the person in the video mentioned it pollution it wont take anyone permission to enter anyone home,Vehicle Emission,Negative

the biggest challenge is how to make people realise that it the air pollution that is causing a pandemic in respiratory and heart disease and not some cooked up virus or mutant ninja people recognise their own role in polluting their air space by driving around endlessly not walking enough and getting addicted to using online shopping that put additional million of scooter and bike which are thrice a polluting a car on our road to satisfy endless want for useless junk or essential these can be bought locally to help their own community instead ride sharing including sharing of petrol cost using electricity only when needed using daylight instead of electricity for lighting during the day in winter one can just cover up with sweater and shawl instead of using room heater which guzzle electricity building home that have roofing of mud tile keep the home naturally cool locally bullock cart transport can be used for short distance delivery horse carriage can be used for night time entertainment and artist can be required to perform unplugged using minimum sound amplification to smaller crowd there are so many way but it the people who have to change and not the government the government is always a reflection of the mentality of the citizenry and so government will continue with the status quo if people are not willing to use their own internal energy from their own body capacity and keep opting for external energy source such a petrol diesel electric or coal otherwise all this effort will just be a waste of gas for fuel in home is 80 time hotter for the environment than burning bio mass and we just can not ignore the global warming scenario by placing gas stove in village where people also will not know how to use it safely gas stove put out co and gas also put out co which is in the severe category zone in all city and even the hill in india co poisoning creates the same symptom in people a the recent covid and now omicron scare the pandemic is being caused by co and young people just out of high school are being instantly given bike and scooter and even car on loan to keep the bank afloat these youngster are unable to walk even for two minute so you are going to have a hard time getting them to cycle walk or hop on the bus and yes the parent are mostly to blame for subsidizing these vehicle loan to youngster the youngster are looking at a zero future if they continue in this direction,Vehicle Emission,Negative

why i really believe that the cracker bursting in diwali should be reduced not terminated is because that the most convenient to do so just think transport is a necessity and though some people are sometimes wrong in not using public transport you ca stop them factory like paper and chemical are useful suddenly stopping them would affect the production drastically but diwali cracker are something which i believe we do because of our culture for festival understand it this way when you are becoming obese instead of stopping eating anything sweet you can just compensate with just one sweet than 5 so that you get taste of it and still do get unhealthy the same way is with diwali cracker burn fuljhadi aanar for your wish just do go above the line i am not saying that the above factory and transport related stuff is good but first we need to control on our negative want after then only we can go to reduce the negative impact of our need,Firecrackers / Farming Practices / Vehicle Emission,Neutral

you can take this suggestion of mine while watching this video the thought came in my mind that we can reduce the some percentage of this big problem like the consumption of wheat and rice in our daily diet so we should modify it we can shift to millet like ragi bajra etc and these crop do not require much water this can also help the farmer and solve the water problem daily consumption of wheat and rice also increase the risk of diabetes and if we try millet in our diet it is also beneficial for our health this small step can be very beneficial for u in future thank you,Farming practices,Positive

mere pas kuch solution hai rather suggestion bol sakte hai vehicle related problem i am from a small town coochbehar but i live in kolkata for education here i see a lot of uppermiddle class people traveling in their own economy segment car under 30 lakh mostly costing around with one or two seat occupied a we know these day car owing become easy for any one because of emi system the government should bring a plan like for private buyer company can not sell ic car under 30 lakh only electric or hydrogen car can be sold because of this the owner ship figure will drop drastically and all the comercial car should be running on cng this way polution will be cut down in half bus that run in route le than 100km should be swapped with elctric bus obviously will take atleast 10 year some would argue that car are important no my friend it not a necessity it luxury if i can live without car you too can whenever needed you just rent a electric or cng stubble burning one thing govt can do is provide the farmer with machine which can uproot those stubble and mix that with soil basically koi machine se mitti aur stubble ko milwa do jisse wo niche ajay aur niche ka mitti upar ajay aur wo jo stubble ho ga wo automatically pach jayga aur fertilizer ka kam karega specially nitrogen fertilizer ki jarurat nehi padegi tab increase very few people know that moss produce ton of oxygen so instead of using fake grass wall for decoration in building or place use moss wall maybe some company make or will make this is just my idea for decoration moss wall will keep your building cool too and will release a lot of oxygen into the industrial polution look india small and large scale industry are centralised in different hotspot of india govt should bring a law that will control the industrialisation of that area there should be a limit in the number of factory in any city and surrounding area if de centralisation of industry happen then many small village and town will also be benifited a the company will setup plant in those area instead of crowded urban area,Vehicle Emission / Farming Practices / Industrial Emission,Positive

A Govt. officer was forced to burn stubble when he went to stop the farmers from doing it. Even the farmers from Punjab won't lie like this and accept that they are the ones burning the stubble. Because they don't see anything wrong with it.

"Being rich is the problem here. Stubble is not burnt in UP, Bihar and Rajasthan but stored or sold to be used as cattle feed and sometimes is burnt as fuel in industries. But being comparatively rich the farmers in Punjab prefer to feed their cattle with other stuff which makes it useless and hence they burn it.   But decomposing it is also not so simple. The sheer volume of it makes its transport difficult and expensive. Decomposition takes time (months) and the stubble can‚Äôt be left in the field for that time because the field has to be prepared for the next crop.  Research has also been done and ways found to convert the stubble into disposable cutlery, but I guess it‚Äôs not feasible commercially. The state governments should have taken some temporary measures, since this is once a year problem.",stubble Burning,Negative
"Other regions farmer do 2 crop cycle, but since Punjab farmer do 3 crop cycle a year, they don‚Äôt have time for other solution, that‚Äôs why they burn it, it‚Äôs an instant solution, also saves money, also is the reason of desertification of landscape",Stubble Burning,Negative

"Kejriwal could have reduced the pollution this year. They are saying that the central govt didn't provide money. But delhi govt and Punjab govt could have used their contribution to at least reduce the stubble burning by some amount.

If you don't burn it and plough it instead it is roughly 5k/ killa(ekad) extra expenses. Small farmers with farms less than 15 killas cannot  bear such costs as their margins are negligible. Richer farmers are above 25 killas and they mostly plough their fields.,Stubble Burning,Negative
"In my state (uttarakhand) farmers fill the farmland with water and then plough through it. Due to this parali can act as a fertilizer, no matter how less of nutrients it provide it's better than burning it i guess.",Stubble Burning,Negative
Oh Maharaj they don't have to spend anything close to that amount on getting rid of it and turning it into khad for themselves if they use the waste decomposer that pusa has made for them. It makes their fields only more fertile and increases the amount of carbon in the soul giving then better harvest in the future. And waste decomposer is much cheaper to make it khad than getting gau ki khad and takes about 1/3 the time to be ready. It's more of a case of old dogs can't learn new tricks (before anyone says anything about me calling farmers dogs let me be clear I also have been a farmer I have nothing but respect for them it's just the saying),Stubble Burning,Negative

"Even the richest farmers have low margins, UP farmers don't bet on rice as much as Punjab, and there are better subsidies in Haryana on bailers. The cost of bailer by itself is a huge undertaking, and Punjab govt. only gives 50% subsidy on it (Haryana gives 80%). I've heard that the price of what the waste sold at is also better in Haryana (likely, but I'm not certain).  There was a news article I read discussing how even with the subsidies it is still economically prohibitive to collect, transport and sell agricultural waste in Punjab. It's not hard to see why the situation is where it is.  Haryana has a horse in the race (Gurgaon), so it makes sense why they care more. I figured with AAP in Punjab, they'd be a bit more sympathetic to the cause (or Delhi would chip in a bit to help) ... but unfortunately, none of that has happened.",Stubble Burning,Negative
Punjabi farmers treat Delhi like shit.  1. Rampage on Red Fort. 2. Try to kill Delhi by using chemical bomb ( parali burning ) 3. Let‚Äôs stop Delhi traffic for one year . Why? Against capitalism and same time burn parali to increase their profit ( that‚Äôs capitalism).,Stubble Burning,Negative

All they did was peacefully protest for their rights.

Monsanto Bayer  You might have heard of them they are the biggest agri commodities companies in the world. Earlier farmers in Punjab (India & Pakistan both) and Haryana used local seeds for cultivation but Monsanto bribed Punjab Govt officials including Agriculture Minister in 2010-12 which allowed GMO crops of Monsanto to be sold in Punjab and Haryana.  These crops have higher shelf life and output per crop yield but lower stubble quality with more stubble growth in plants.   The stubble is sold at lower prices which doesn‚Äôt cover the cost and stubble is useless for these farmers hence the only alternative to remove the stubble before the next sowing season is to burn it. It‚Äôs efficient and quick process for farmers but causes a lot of pollution as you know it.   As of today there is no foolproof process to dispose or decompose of stubble and that too all of Punjab and Haryana. Plus Pakistani farmers are also burning the stubble even if we find a solution for Indian farmers still you need to check the Pakistan farmers stubble burning. Either this or somehow you change the wind direction to South West or North West    Have you heard of Roundup you can Google it and it‚Äôs harmful effects.

People who are hurling abuses and straight up calling this propaganda are just ignorant fools who have no idea how poor people survive in the country. MSP will help lakhs of poor farmers who have very small fields and barely grow enough to survive and sustain their families. Read and inform yourself on the matter instead of scrolling on your phones 24x7. Protests are supposed to be inconvenient. That's what make them effective. And with the mainstream media bootlicking the government, harsh majors have to be taken by the citizens who have some demands from the government.   German farmers also protested just recently and thousands of tractors entered central Berlin which obstructed the traffic.

Simple solution identify the farmers who are burning stubble and put theirs children and old parents in room for 24 hours with same environment as delhi filled with toxic gas and PM 2.5 level 999.

"There is no solution. Other than Delhi declaring holiday for a week.   Those farmers have been burning stubble for centuries. They're not gonna change. It's the fastest way to clear the fields for the next crop. Yield efficiency is everything for farmers.   It doesn't matter if it's AAP, BJP, Congress or Trump incharge. Nothing can be done until we create a technology to artificially change wind direction.",Stubble Burning,Neutral
"What are you saying? It has not been going on for centuries! It's has actually increased dramatically in last 5-6 years. Only and only because buring the is cheapest and the least effort taking method.  It's also illegal to do that as per the law, it's just law enforcement have zero regards to it. We need good law enforcement. That's it.  Burning also harms the soil.",Stubble Burning,Neutral
"Not going to happen anytime soon govt needs to invest crores of money every year on it. There is a window of 25-40 days in which all the farmers in the Haryana Punjab region harvest rice and put the paralli waste there and now they have around 10 days to start preparing land for the next cropping season. So the only cheap, easy and traditional practice is to burn it, as the quantity is huge to take care of a proper supply chain is needed and there are huge risks of storing the paralli as it can cause massive fires. Massive funding investments from govt and private sectors are needed which may not give any attractive returns. Farmers need to pay rent, diesel, labors for even asking the baler contractor to collect the paralli without getting anything, therefore burning is the easiest way out for them.",Stubble Burning,Negative
It's actually not allowed as per the high court directives. It's just that law enforcement isn't upto the mark. It can be controlled easily if heavy fines are imposed.,Stubble Burning,Negative

"Increase the prices for stubble. If the govt pays 100 Rs per kg then the farmers would be flocking to sell them instead of burning them. The govt can then decompose it on their own and sell it back as organic manure to industries/farmers.  Of course, this will cost a lot to the exchequer but then we don't have to force anyone not to burn the crops (via laws that are difficult to enforce) and everyone is happy.",Stubble Burning,Negative
Bhai inhe pehle hi govt. Msp de rahi hai for growing rice ab stubble ke liye bhi degi to desh bankrupt ho jayega. 99% MSP for rice that govt. buys goes to punjab. During farmer protest they were demanding all their crops to be bought at msp.,Stubble Burning,Negative

The parties are going to use all the excuses they can find to pull each other down and win elections.  Its up to us to stop being reactionary and get pulled into their games. Think from a big picture perspective.   Having political opinions is not like picking a sports team and defending it to the death no matter what.     Its about how things work out on the long term with a mishmash of whatever policies or    steps any party takes when they come into power. Totally unpredictable how that pans out.

The guy spent crores promoting some solution he made in association with PUSA which will turn Stubble in manure and today after spending crores he doesn't even talks about that.

Instead of cleaning Yamuna as he promised 7 years ago, he is using harmful chemical to remove toxic form for Chhath Pooja?? Still people like you support him in every shit he pulls out.

"We know it can't be resolved in a snap of finger. But last year keju blamed it completely on parali. Go and check his statements, he blamed it so much on parali that people started targeting farmers for polluting Delhi, which is obviously absurd. He gave a statement where he said that he has controlled parali burning in Delhi and it's Punjab and Haryana that are causing Delhi's pollution.  Everyone is correct to go after him now that he has government in Punjab. If parali was the reason, did he do anything? Was he lying all along? How do you explain it?  Also, did he bring any policies to reduce pullution. Even if he banned truck entry in daytime, did it had any effect? Why shouldn't we go after him if he is just blaming it on others rather than taking any concrete steps?",government,Negative

"Agreed, but even if that issue is resolved, would it actually help the pollution levels year round ? Look at the difference in the scale of contributions from each category.   If this is true, shouldn't we be prioritizing providing cleaner fuels to these households at a bigger scale rather than going after farmers every year?  No doubt that stubble burning needs to stop as well( and it has been gradually decreasing) but it looks like household pollution has pretty much been overlooked so far since individual contributions are low.

"The issue is actually a water issue from Punjab.   Secondly the issue is more metrological and parali is not the only source of pollution, the metrological part is the air is entrapped due to geography of Indo-gangetic plane. The parali bit is a small factor local pollution is major factor. Road dust, waste burning, vehicle and industrial exhaust are larger contributors.   Punjab govt since 2014 introduced a policy to limit the ground water consumption so they wanted farmers to plant seeds at a certain time. That leaves a small window to get rid of rice straw. Now this was not a concern before as the rice straw would naturally decompose.  You think farmers want to burn the crop, nope they too breathe this.  The farmer greed due to MSP and habit is causing them to grow rice, which we have in excess and each kg of rice needs 500+ L of water.  Now the machines to cut the straw are expensive and not all available at the time of harvest so they burn the crop.  Punjab needs to grow other crops, rice is simply not suitable for this area due to its high water requirements.  The govt made a terrible, corporation motivated attempt without any real alternatives and sudden change with no talks with farmers, so it failed. Adding the political backlash with the deaths and lack of empathy from the centre.  Parali is a water issue of Punjab.  Solutions  1. Tax rice so its not worth growing. Or cancel msp but with alternatives. 2. Clear MSP much higher for oil seeds which are currently imported. 3. Dialog with farmers. 4. Lottery system to who gets to grow rice. 5. Machines that can cut and bale the straw plus fermenting additives for faster natural degradation. 6. Water table recharge. 7. Grow paddy in other area. 8.

"Man there are a lot of ways to dispose off stubble, instead of burning them. But the farmers are reluctant to do any of them, cause they require additional efforts. Moreover the soil of Punjab is unsuitable for growing paddy(rice) but still the farmers keep on growing them at the cost of environment (by using excessive water, fertilisers and harmful chemicals). You need to understand that all the farmers are currently thinking of is their profit, they are the least bothered about environment. So yeah we are blaming them cause they are the ones to be blamed.      |As demand rose for more production, more land started to be used for agriculture. But govt didn't help them to cope up with these demands by providing enough tools to efficiently grow and switch between the crops.      In Punjab farmers take loans, and send their children to foreign countries with that money, then they protest that the crops have not given enough profit to repay the loan. Eventually the loans are exempted and you can see that Punjab is one of the worst performing economy in the country with loses increasing way more than profits.      In every single country people prefer AC cars and AC offices over everything and also the demand for AC is the highest in summers, still the AQI is highest in November when most people stop using AC.",Stubble Burning,Positive

Why are the farmers the only one blamed for it ? If the state had better planning, incentive for diverse crop production and tools required for them, why wouldn't they do it?  AC and AQI, that's our problem and that's how state response is as well. They wait until the patients start dying on the doorstep of hospitals. Since it is difficult to breathe in November, that is when we care for environment. Simply put, until it affect us, we don't care.   No doubt November condition is due to stubble burning. But that's what I started with, this practice of stubble burning has been there for decades, why is it the problem now only ? If it was only farmer then it would be problem sinces ages. Why is it an issue only now ?  It's because of the accumulative pollution from different sources and stubble burning acts as a catalyst during this season.",Stubble Burning,Positive

"If you look at the AQI map...it gives you a very clear idea.  1.

Delhi is not just Delhi, its Gurgram, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad cbined has millions of cars running on streets all the time. During the early winters, as the temperature goes down moisture in the air condenses and these polutants dilute in the suspended water particles...ie SPM. PM2.5 and PM10 are usually the biggest culprits 3. Then comes all the local construction projects. The dust and microparticles from these under construction sites houses those reactions.

"Generally the eastern parts of any city are more polluted (and less rich) than the western parts. This is true for any city in the world,  London,  Paris, Berlin,  Bangalore etc. This is because there is little bit more wind from the west to east than the east to west (due to earth's rotation). Delhi and UP are the easternmost areas of the world. Any pollution generated anywhere in Europe, Middle East, Pakistan, Punjab and anywhere else slowly travel east until they hit the Himalayas. This causes air pollution in Delhi and UP, and stagnant wind patterns in the same areas.   So,  answer is Himalayas.",Pakistan,Positive

I do realise certain improper and mismanaged ways used in farming and how they immensely contribute negatively to the air we breathe in here but pardon me to point out that the 'No farmers No pollution' tag is kinda stupid to put forth. The choice of words is incorrect and the message you might want to put forth doesn't have good enough a bracket. You do realise the consequences of having no famers in a country right!?

I saw Arvind kejriwal came up with some sort of chemicals to remove the stubble of the crop. I feel the need of the hour is to find ways to solve the problems instead of pinning it on farmers. Govt should interfere and come up with lucrative ways to find an alternative and educate the farmers about that method. None of the farmers would want to burn the stubble of there was a cheaper alternate. Only jointly can they resolve the issue. Otherwise it's just farmers pointing at govt. and vice versa.,Government,Neutral

"I personally don't burst them. Up until now I used to persuade others to do the same. But I realised last year that sure, not bursting them is the correct mentality, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really make a difference. This is not me being nihilistic, it's just that the fact is, majority of the pollution is caused by manufacturing plants/factories. And to expect someone to take up the burden of these factories and not celebrate their favourite festival in the way they like, that too just once a year, seems wrong. I still won't burst them, but that's from a principle point of view, rather than a making impact one and I won't ask anyone else not to burst them .  Also I think it's false that one day of (proper) firecracker bursting is solely responsible for the AQI problem we have post diwali. I strongly believe that it is mainly coz of the crop field burning in punjab and haryana but the media doesn't talk about that enough for some reason .  P.

Stubble burning should be banned and use of firecrackers, not only on Diwali but throughout the year should be banned. There should be a mandatory odd/even system for atleast 2 months every year.

"Against. I'll explain why.  Crackers aren't actually part of the original Diwali celebrations, they were added on later in history for spectacle. They don't have religious significance. Diyas are the 'light' part of the 'festival of lights'. Now I don't mind kids trying fuljhari for fun (I used to too) or people gathering to see some fireworks, because it would not severely impact the environment. But those who stubbornly burn hundreds or thousands of crackers every Diwali to 'protect religion' are either ignorant or in complete denial about the damage they are causing to people, animals and nature. You can deny its impact as much as you want, but the evidence appears every year in front of our eyes, and in hospitals.   Religion teaches to be an upstanding member of society and think about the impact of your actions. But if such folks choose to make the AQI worse for everyone while KNOWING the stubble issue is coming, then they are no religious protectors. They are egoistic people with zero kindness for society.",Stubble Burning,Positive

People like you and me have stopped burning crackers but have the farmers even after a law being in place ever stopped burning their stubble?  NO.  Because they know that nobody in this country can point their fingers on farmers because   1. Our movie industry has created this image that all farmers are poor and work really hard.  2. Farmers are the biggest vote banks so much so that even the wealthiest farmers pays 0 tax after earning crores. Such is the case that even Amitabh Bacchan tried to show himself as a farmer just to evade taxes. Google it yourself.  3. Farmers destroying property or causing jams and bandhs can never be questioned because they are always facing hardships.,Stubble Burning,Negative

Secondly, idk bout this year but few years ago it was the case that most crackers were made in China. If it's still the case now I wonder ab nationalism kha gya? Bs social media pe show krna hota hai?  Correct me if I'm wrong bout crackers thing but I'm very inclined to believe they r still bought from China.

"Some background:  The Indian state of Punjab has two growing seasons: one from May to September and another from November to April.   Many farmers rotate between crops, planting rice in May and wheat in November.   In order to quickly prepare their fields for the wheat crop, many farmers simply burn leftover plant debris after harvesting rice. The practice is known as paddy stubble burning.  Every year, Punjab rice farms collectively burn about 7 to 8 million metric tons of leftover plant debris in October and November.

"> crackers by releasing dangerous chemicals (yes even green ones)   Dangerous chemicals are also released by stubble burning. The stubble has a ton of residue of pesticides, weedicides and fertilizers. All burned at a massive scale. They also needlessly kill a massive amount of pollinators.  > Both cause pollution.  Everything causes pollution bhai, it's the scale of the pollution which matters. And stubble burning is much larger in scale as compared to diwali.

Coming to the point of the pollution, resolving it was never as simple. No amount of subsidised harvesters, bio decomposers,   ""parali"" processing units can win over a 2 rupee matchbox and the quick turn around to get the field ready for the next crop. It's a long process, the govt would need to encourage different varieties of grain that mature at a relatively different time rather than getting ready around the same time Delhi's weather and wind flow are the worst.

I have never seen a leader inaugrating a new school, college, hospital or any welfare establishments for the society.  They only have a moto to support 10% of the people in India, rather than 90% who are not privileged.   BJP prime agenda is to keep you away from education, so that you never ask questions,  promote hate, communal riots, and derogatory statements.  These jokers are erasing chapters in history books of class 5,6,7,8, of mughal's.  BJP you can never create Hindu rashtre, because this India belongs to sovereign, diversity and The Preamble.

Congress doesn't have leaders and neither the mindset. Though we as a nation had progressed a lot through Congress reign, I don't think they have it in them to take us to the next level.

Voted for kejriwal after he failed to get complete seats in Delhi. Was highly demotivated because person played blame games instead of doing work.  First time voted for modi in 2019 lok sabha thought we should give second chances. But just like kejriwal he kept crying(till today) congress doesn't want him because he is from obc, inflation has doubled, taxes are sky rocketing, buy petroleum from russia to sell to ghae(usa). Bringing pedophilic education to indian(him/her/her). Bow downs to qatar, throws woman to wolves, did nothing for palghar sadhus justice. Want to tax more so that he can feed 80 crore instead of providing Better opportunity in term jobs/education. Hates nehru but wants to be like nehru. Bow downs to rioters, does nothing.  Congress - rahul is pushed by family to follow their family business so they won't let anyone else leads. Still believe sheila dixit handles delhi in turn of riots.   Present day me believes every politician is a chor and doesn't care about citizens, their aim is to stay in power by hook, crook, lie, deception and deceit. They don't about you or your family.

"I don't want to comment on the political aspect of it but the reason it is being is done because -  the faulty trifurcation of the¬†Municipal corporation ¬†of Delhi in 2012 left major revenue projects and high property tax wielding colonies to the south civic body, while major hospitals and services requiring a lot of¬†money¬†for operations went to the north body. The east corporation was unfortunate too to inherit the bulk of the city‚Äôs slum clusters and unauthorised colonies.  Hence the need of unification.  For further info do check this out   [Reason for unification of MCD](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/corpns-seek-strength-in-unity-mull-merger-of-finance-depts/articleshow/80798779.cms)",General/Other,Negative
"But the unification can be done even after the elections, councillors only have to sit in one house instead of three. BJP, being in power for 7 years could have done the unification earlier too, but doing this just days before election is only of fear of getting wiped out in municipality election.",General/Other,Neutral
"There is a pending work to merge the north, south, and east mcd, I guess delhi cantt and new delhi too. So that's why elections got delayed. This may be motivated by election gains  but bjp said it's doing so that there will be no salary delays, and no delays in projects get done.  Right now there are 4 or 5 different mayors working and work get delayed due red tapism. After unification there will be only one mayor so things will get done fast. But yes this needs to be done earlier.",General/Other,Positive
"I can bet my left testicle that Delhi Cantt. and New Delhi will not be merged with MCD.   The biggest problem with the MCDs is not red tapism but corruption. The Ghost Employees scam, where around 20% of the workforce was found to be on paper only, showed how these organizations are rotten to the core.",General/Other,Positive
"Also, the earnings are disproportionate, south mcd has a higher revenue from property taxes than east and north combined.",General/Other,Positive
"Ah yes sure. No issues with unification. It'll help in decisions getting implemented quicker but the thing is BJP could've unified 3 civic bodies anytime post 2014 but they didn't and the day they announced unification was the day when poll dates were about to be announced. They frickin postponed the polls. Unification can be done after the polls as well but nahi, postpone karo bas.",General/Other,Positive
"Downvote me to hell but let me tell you why the MCD was disintegrated in the first place - MCD had always been the BJP bastion even when INC kept winning the state elections. INC wanted to break the same, they had the Govt in the centre and in the state and decided to go ahead with the same. Reunification of the MCD will help in integration of all the resources, including financial and the properties. It will help in better organisation, help in better transfer of funds between different area - for instance in the current scenario, one MCD may be running in deficit and one may be running in surplus financially, after the unification, funds could be transferred accordingly to different areas. It may be politically motivated but there are legitimate reasons behind proposing reunification of the MCD.",General/Other,Positive
">Downvote me to hell  None is gonna do that. What you are saying is logical.  But again, doing unification exactly at the time of elections and postponing the election by this, seems wrong and unjust. Shifting to election to favour themselves is wrong on so many levels.",General/Other,Neutral
"MCD is BJP's prowess since 15 years. After 2014 LS victory, they could've unified 3 bodies anytime. But they decided to do so only when?!?? there was AAP wave all across.   Dude, MCD should be unified; no issues with that. You can do the same after polls but why the hell and how you can defer the polls? That too by one year?!",Government,Neutral
"Hey OP, I don't know about ulterior motive thing but I had  read something 2-3 years back too about reunification of 3 MCDs of delhi. This reunification talk is not new.  After Digging up some information, I found .......  MCD was divided in 2011 but divide was not even in terms of area covered and revenue collection. South Delhi MCD apparently earned much more than other two.  As a result, there was a huge gap in the resources available to the three corporations and  their obligations.  With time, this Gap has increased, increasing the financial constraints of each MCD, sometimes  leaving them unable  to make timely payment of salaries and retirement benefits to employees.  This merging was proposed back in 2018.   >And regarding postponement of election date announcement.   Apparently there are few legal issues still not finalised. That's why election date wasn't announced.",General/Other,Positive

"Came to Delhi in the year 2016. During my first winter, I smelt a very strong fragrance in the air which was somehow similar to ripe cardamom (as I vaguely remember from my one time encounter with ripe cardamom during childhood ). I thought some mobile vendor was around the colony, selling ripe cardamom. In the next few winters I had the same experience over and over again. On one occasion I even stumbled upon the fallen flower responsible for the fragrance (and thus realized that it is not the smell of ripe cardamom) but even then my brain never recognized the connection between the time of the year and the fragrance. In 2021 while I was passing through Defence Colony in South Delhi, I got the smell again and it suddenly struck me, ""Wait! I get this smell every year just when winter is approaching"". I asked the cab driver if he recognized the smell and whether this flower blooms only during the advent of winter. He had no clue. Few days ago, I got the smell again. This time, I went around asking my colleagues and friends who were born and brought up in Delhi. All of them are clueless. In other words, none of them has been able to identify the pattern... ""Smell Come, Winter come"". So, just a while ago I did a Google search ""Delhi winter fragrance"" and read an article on Indian Express, attributing the fragrance to saptaparni tree. The next search result was this reddit post. I Googled images of the tree and showed it to my colleagues and all of them are able to identify it, although they are still oblivious to its connection with the advent of winter. The admin officer said to me,""mere ko toh aisa kabhi mehsus nahin  hua. Leken agar aapko mehsus hua, toh aapka dimaag bariya hai"". I feel smart, and thus, happy lol!  NB: Speaking from experience, do not smell the flower up close. It is nauseating.",Government,Positive

In case you go cancelled way and accident happens Uber ola won't give a shit as they can clearly say that you cancelled the ride and you went on your risk.

If answer to any of the above questions is not as per their convenience they would either tell you straightaway or would not say anything and would not even cancel the ride asking you to cancel.

If a driver asks you to pay them directly, make sure that they cancel and negotiate the fare.   Drivers might also cancel or ask to cancel if the payment is online as they prefer having hard cash on them.

"1. Doing too much for a person who didn't deserve my love. She was the love of my life and I was just another guy for her she had slept with. The sad part is whenever I asked her about us she said I'm the only man she could ever love. I felt like an ass when everything unfolded and I was able to understand the truth. I still feel so.   2. Slapping my sister when I was 15. We got into an argument, she is 5 years older than me. She slapped me and I slapped her back. I am a guy and obviously stronger than her.  Her slap didn't do much damage but my slap ruptured her eardrum. She is fine now. But back then I was rediculed by the entire family and was given the silent treatment for several months after the incedent. I felt sorry and I said it several times .. but yeah that still hurts me.   3. Got into a fight, thrashed the guy so bad that he became kinda mentally abnormal for a few days. He started and he was older than me, he had few friends along and I was alone; but I should've controlled my anger and shouldn't have let that happen to the extent it got.   4. I was roughly 7 or 8 years old. We were in a remote village of Kerala and I along with a friend were playing in the fields.. We saw discus throw on TV and we were trying to mimic it. Holding a big chunk of rock, which was barely fitting in our palms...  While the stupid me was spinning holding a huge ass rock I never thought the rock would go straight and hit my friend on this head.  He was rushed to the hospital and I was asked to stay away from my only friend by everyone..  People thought I did it on purpose.. It was a small village and every piece of information used to spread like wildfire... So everyone knew... The shopkeepers, my school friends, my neighbours... Everyone kinda made me feel bad about it repeatedly.   These were my deepest regrets and they still haunt me. I have good memory and can't forget these things... They still don't let me sleep at times..",philosophy/life,Positive

"Slightly rarer, but something I feel for. Listen, if you are a gifted kid, frequently reaching the highest levels of achievement in the talent pool in your immediate vicinity, or if you are the parent of such a kid, it is very important that you create avenues to set a higher benchmark to keep interesting and challenging yourself and keep practicing, whatever it is that the said talent is.  Today the avenues are plenty compared to long ago. Reach out to enthusiast groups on FB, see what the pros in your field are doing on YouTube, do problems from 2-3+ grades above you if it's maths, physics, etc. Whatever you pick up shouldn't dishearten you, it's just important that you find next thing that you can aim for. This is applicable for everyone, but often it's the gifted kids that miss out developing to their full potential because of how easily there could be nobody to guide them. And stating the obvious, it's incredibly rare to be gifted.  On a separate note, just telling my story as it could hopefully drive home the point for someone listening, I feel I was such a kid. Could do linear equations in 4-5th grade, worked out crude divisibility tests for 7 by myself in 7th, figured out concept of derivatives and how it could be used to find max-min of graphs in 9th, etc. While all this might not sound like much to some folks, this all happened fairly independently, with nobody really guiding me (no exposure at all to entrance exams/coaching till 11th grade). But then there came a point where I stopped really trying around 9th grade because of the only challenge there was around - school exams.

Best answer. No need to comment for anyone else,General,Positive
Exactly.   One thing not in favour of burning firecrackers in large quantities is that they use a lot of harmful chemicals. Enforcing green crackers hasn‚Äôt panned out well cause many times manufacturers use shortcuts to keep costs down.   There is an immediate spike in particulate matter a day after cause of uneven burn. This usually settles down in a day.

"I'll also go ahead and share a previous comment of mine.     A study was published in June 2022, the lead author from IIT-D, showing the apportionment and speciation of pm 2.5 due to fire crackers and stubble burning throughout 2021. Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.      An alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment. Biological accumulation in nearby fishes and crops also occur as all these heavy metal particulate matter settle down in to soil and get absorbed.      Composition of pollutants due to parali or stubble burning is mainly black carbon, which also have serious adverse effects in the long run.      Area under the curve can help you to find the total contribution by of these several sources of air pollution .      Link to study: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101428 Study conducted by IIT Delhi .

"Firecrackers definitely add on to the pollution. Think of it as adding one spoon of salt in a bucket full of water everyday for an year vs adding another extra spoon of salt on a single day(or a week). The effect of the extra 1-7 spoons of salt is nothing compared to what is being added to the bucket everyday. Also, environment has a tendency to clean itself, if given proper time. Governments are just trying to hide behind crackers for their incompetence in regulating vehicular and industrial pollution. If you go out today, just see how many cars on the road are being driven by a single occupant in them or how many people who live nearby a shop drive their Activa, scooters instead of walking and few 100-1000 steps. It should give you an Idea, how bursting crackers is insignificant.",Health/Environment,Positive

Most of the Instagram are filled with 12-20 years old who have been given the drugs if religion in the last 5-10 years. They will even stoop to any level to defend their dharma not even knowing an iota of what does it actually mean. They will openly profess of burning crackers despite being  a blanket ban throughout the country just to make their point. Science and logic has taken a back seat ever since  2014. Pollution has negative externality i.e. it affect thise also who jave not done anything to make it.

Firecrackers cause pollution. Air and land both. I personally wouldn‚Äôt have problems with them if our air was clean af and our streets were maintained. But our air quality is already fucked and our streets are dirtiest.  Then what‚Äôs the sense in adding to the problem. For two minutes of fun people are ruining lives of so many people.

Well look at it this way   Acc to some current pollution is the reason of last diwali  On the other hand diwali adds up only for one or two days and government wants to blame the public for pollution therefore keeps the blamelight on diwali   Whereas they don't blame the firecrackers Punjabi farmers are burning and the dust coming from construct sites,Health/Environment,Positive

No.  So whats the issue, the issue is, Delhis air quality is already worst, so now people act in a very counter productive way, that since Delhi is already polluted, we will burn crackers, hence creating more pollution, but since Delhi was already polluted, many people just make themselves to believe that its fine, its the same argument that when one wall in In delhi is covered with pan masala and tobacco stains, people have no problem in dirting it more, since its already dirty, most people dont care.  Ideally you should not burn crackers, but then again nothing is ideal in this world.",Health/Environment,Positive

"People defend them because they think it‚Äôs tied to their right to celebrate Diwali and that Hindu rituals are under attack. Makes no sense.   The thing is if Diwali happened in the middle of June, it wouldn‚Äôt be such a problem. But it coincides with the stubble burning practice season and fog season. Fog is basically water vapour that pollutants mix with and affect visibility and makes respiratory illnesses worse.   Overall it‚Äôs a very simple calculation. Just don‚Äôt do it. Bursting crackers is not a religious practice and the upside (few hours of fun) is outweighed by the downside (days/weeks of poor health for the most vulnerable + bonus harm of patronage to child labour).",Health/Environment,Negative

"Yes in the short term, they do increase pollution(the next day after diwali is always more smoggy). But that pollution is not persistent. Delhi has pollution during the whole year which comes from its own persistent issues. In the name of development, we have cut down trees and what not.   People only focus on pollution during Oct, Nov but the uncomfortable truth is that Delhi's AQI remains bad in remaining months as well, as can be seen from the monthly data.  Pressure on governments has to be maintained during the whole year. The only AQI level that should be acceptable to us should be 50.",Health/Environment,Positive
"Definitely yes, but compared to the overall mess here, nope. You can simply observe around Diwali or read aqi level online. People are happy to inhale 2 days of ""zeher"" than to stop bursting them. Also, SC has banned them all over India.   Stop connecting with it religion not everything is about it. Things change with time. You have to understand India can't afford them right now.

Spike is there but not so substantial. Moreover unlike firecrackers are burnt for a week at most.. that pollution would go away in a week or so.. Unlike Stubble burning that chokes for more than a month.,Health/Environment,Positive
"The problem is multidimensional. 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Climate- cold air mass, not much wind speed to dissipate the smog and local disturbances.  2Ô∏è‚É£ Stubble Burning near Punjab and Haryana- the smoke and particulates move eastwards and settle down with cold air mass. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicular and Population density of Dehi- NCR    These three factors cause the pollution. Usually with the third factor being controlled, we see only PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants. But, with bursting of firecrackers you are introducing Poisonous gases like oxides of Sulphur and Nitrogen. This is what causes severe health issues very quickly. PM 2.5 and PM 10 is manageable upto a level. It's very toxic when all the four are introduced into the air.",Health/Environment,Negative
"So it should be a collective effort. When we can show them that we are ready to solve the issue, we as the electorates can pressurise the politicians.

"Honestly speaking, YES they do, but not this much what we are seeing now. It'll be very temporary like for 2-3 days and then gone. This ban is because there is already smoke, firecrackers will make it unbearable and become lethal. Another thing is fire smoke is mostly CO2 which can be balanced by trees, firecracker smoke also have carbon monoxide, which kills ozone also.",Firecrackers,Positive
"Depends on your definition of pollution. Pollution is not caused by a single pollutant. It can be due to PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, O3, CO, etc.  While crackers generally don't cause spikes in PM2.5, they certainly cause a lot of other pollution like heavy metal oxides, NOx, SO2 etc. Those coming up with that IITD study don't know what it was about. It was merely about PM2.5, crackers don't add oxygen to the air lol. 'Anything', literally anything burning (combusting/oxidising) can cause pollution. It may or may not be substantial but doesn't mean we need to do it.",Health/Environment,Negative

People can change any moment and you need to be ready for it .   The only solution is to immerse yourself in work and be busy . Nothing else works , tried it all. Took a 10 day break , went to Kerala with family (impromptu decision) , 2 din me plan karke chale gye . but the memories come back time and again . Working on yourself , immersing yourself in work and TIME , are the only ways which will help it heal .   OP ,it's inevitable to forget her .

"Same boat, 2.5 years relationship.   Going to mcleodganj soon for a week for the same reason as yours, (would advice you to do the same since the long weekend can be crowded)   Gonna try stuff alone, go for trecks and all :)   It is pretty comfortable-ish place (esp if you get sunlight). There are trecks, places you can go using the buses (cheaper than taxis) or just try out the cafes and museums.    There are tea plantations as well nearby, and you can go to bir billing as well if you get bored.  I hope it helps you, sending lots of hugs ;_;  Things you can try from the top of my head: 1. triund treck (very beginner friendly, have been doing it for the past two years), up until the midpoint cafe is very doable. 2. Tibet museum 3. Bhagsu falls, temple 4. Shiva cafe on top of bhagsu falls (loved the sunset there) 5. Tea plantations 6. Can visit bir billing, it is relatively less crowded than the rest of himachal, the locals are very helpful :). 7. If you go to bir, try the toy train from Joginder nagar to some place you feel comfy, and take a bus back.  8. There is a pottery village called Andretta nearby, which lets you try pottery for free, haven‚Äôt been there personally but you can find the studios on Instagram.  9. Also, try the monasteries while you are at bir and mcdj, amazing places.  You can stay at the hostels, would will be able to meet new people :D   I hope you heal and find peace :)).",philosophy/life,Positive

"Bro I don't think a solo trip will help you cope with this situation because I have firsthand experience. After my breakup, I went to Rajasthan and stayed in a hostel to meet new people and explore the city, but the truth is that if your mind isn't calm at home, it's unlikely to be calm elsewhere, and your first solo trip will be a letdown.  My advice would be to join a volunteering group in your city where you can interact and volunteer with new people, or if you want to go on a trip, either go with a friend you enjoy spending time with or go in group packages where you will be accompanied by others.",Tourism,Positive

"Hi OP. Break ups suck. Im going through one too. But i knew that mine was going to end a long time ago- so i started reading books, podcasts/videos/movies about break ups and heart breaks to get myself ready for when it actually happens. I read your comments- you feel like she was your only one, you will never be able to love again and the pain would never end. So, a couple points that might help you:  1. Most people feel this way after a break up (especially if its your first). 2. It‚Äôs scientifically proven that human beings fall in love multiple times with multiple people. 3. Once you start detaching yourself from the break up (which takes time) you will start to realise things that were wrong with the relationship 4. If you heal in a right way, chances are you will move on to a better and healthier relationship than your last. 5. After a while, nobody really regrets the break up. They mostly never want to go back to their ex- partner 6. Break ups are a time of transformation. Remember pain creates art.

"If you look at the AQI map...it gives you a very clear idea.  1. Crop burning in Punjab and Haryana is the highest pollutant contributor, all that unburnt particles flies staright to Delhi with wind 2. Delhi is not just Delhi, its Gurgram, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad cbined has millions of cars running on streets all the time. During the early winters, as the temperature goes down moisture in the air condenses and these polutants dilute in the suspended water particles...ie SPM. PM2.5 and PM10 are usually the biggest culprits 3. Then comes all the local construction projects. The dust and microparticles from these under construction sites houses those reactions.  Lower temperature works as a catalyst to fast tract this whole process making record high 500+ AQI    Some might be surprised the only reason of Ozone Hole forming in the Arctic is the super low temperature allowing NOx gases to combine with water and form a toxic cloud.",Pollution,Positive
"1. If lower temperatures are catalysts than we should see AQI throughout the world going up winter from wherever they are in summer.  2. Crop burning has been happening for decades‚Ä¶ but this level of pollution was not there. what changed in the last 10 years?  3. Same level of cars were also there, and the construction.

>If AQI is 500 on Diwali it will be 1000 after. Unless rains or wind picks up.  You can't just throw random numbers just like that dude. Go back and check AQI of Delhi every year. When did it peak? When stubble burning happened in that year? When did diwali fall on that year? You have to look at data for multiple years and then argue.  >Diwali is still a contributor.  So does the bike on the street. But by how much? What percentage? How much happens by industries? How much happens by vehicle? How much happens by crackers?  If you don't have time to research all that then do Google. There is multiple research by different institutions. You have to check all of them and come to a conclusion.

"This is actually not true.   There are many factors that contribute to pollution. Stubble burning, vehicle pollution, and industries are the major ones.

It was and always has been the easiest to solve by banning them during this time.  However the main contributors of stubble burning, vehicles, and industries are hard to solve and requires serious political will which is lacking in India",Health/Environment,Negative

"I think people knew it but cronies didn't want the farmer stubble burning come to the view   In addition to it, Diwali shouldn't be about cracker burning and politicians just blamed the general public which was easier.  Look you burn crackers( which does cause pollution) hence let's blame it on that.  Now with newer data and more media presence and info coming from all sectors and worsening pollution way ahead of diwali has brought in more real truth   Also we have to take into account 6 7 yrs back fewer factories was there. More forest coverage everything was better nature wise and hence we saw lesser destruction.  But now the ability of environment to heal on its own is reduced.  So everything and everyone causing pollution has to be blamed equally be it farmers or festivals.",Health/Environment,Positive
"Stubble burning isn‚Äôt main cause  Don't watch those news channels, see govt reports yourself.

The director of Centre for Science and Environment alleged that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers is lobbying ""against the report"" because it is ""inconvenient"" to the automobile industry...  A study in 2016 measured the sources and average levels of various types of air pollution in Delhi.  Of PM2.5 pollution, 38% came from road dust, 20% to vehicles, 12% to domestic fuel burning, and 11% to industrial point sources.  Of PM10 pollution, 56% came from road dust, 10% from concrete batching, 10% from industrial point sources, and 9% from vehicles.  Of NOx emissions, 52% came from industrial point sources (mostly from power plants and 36% from vehicles (but the 36% was potentially more damaging due to being emitted close to people).  Of SO2 emissions, 90% came from industrial point sources. Of CO emissions, 83% came from vehicles.  The large contributions of vehicles and road dust to air pollution have been made worse by court-ordered restrictions on bus service in Delhi, which had the effect of accelerating the purchase of private cars and the construction of roads to accommodate them.

"That's actually a good question. I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:  1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.  2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.  3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc.   Police lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.  But what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.  Earlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors. They are happy that protestors were repressed because it's one less problem for them.  So now if you are an educated middle class person upset with pollution what do you do? Probably too scared to organise a protest. Even if you organize one others are afraid to come. Then who knows whether you will get police permission or not.",Health/Environment,Positive

It's a bit harder to breathe but The trick is not to push past the aerobic pace and stay in z1 or z2 zone at max. If you've been running regularly and have a better aerobic base than the average Joe then you should be fine within those limits. Poor aqi and high pm2.5 particles in air start adversely affecting your lungs after one hour only so you should keep your running time under it. To know you are staying at an easy aerobic jogging pace, breathe through nostrils and if you feel you need to breathe through mouth know that you're running at an unwanted higher pace so avoid that and you will be fine. Look its better to go out and work the lungs instead of sitting on your ass and munching on food. When your goal is to be fit, something is always better than nothing no matter what anyone says. You will not breathe any cleaner air in and around your house anyway so don't let the aqi number get to your head. At the end of the day everyone is at a different level so do it and see how it feels instead of asking folks that don't do any running at all. Gand daba ke baithnewale gyan chodenge duniya bhar ka.

One side should stop the moral policing, and the other side should celebrate responsibly.  Also, Punjab isn't the only state that sends us food. We don't just eat rice and wheat, do we?

Nobody is doing Delhi any favours, mind you. The incessant stubble burning by Punjab farmers is literally arm twisting of the state machinery. They are untouchable now. They do as they please, and one fine day, people will get out of this needless glorification of farmers. Especially the farmers of Haryana and Punjab, as nearly 90% of the MSP goes to them! (While farmers of other states get pennies because they are not a vote bank)  Yes, they produce food but it comes at a cost. Financial, Administerial and most importantly Environmental.",Firecrackers,Positive
">Punjab isn't the only state that sends us food.

I understand ur desire to contribute and applaud it. but in order to address any problem we must first understand it. and the truth of the matter is that its not created by common man, neither it can be solved by individual actions of common man. Let alone solve, it cant be even addressed properly by a common person.  what we can do is by the agency of govt only. here i would like to point out that govt is not some alien or superior entity. its a servant created by people to serve their common interest. and this situation is a precise example of one in which collective action is required which can be generated by govt. so ur saying lets not talk about putting responsibility is wrong. thats exactly what we should do - create more awareness about both the issue and the abject failure of govt worldwide to address it due to greed and corruption.",General,Negative

"My question to all the people of Delhi who burst crackers on Diwali.  Diwali is celebrated because Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya and was coronated to become the king.  So, did the people of Ayodhya burst a loads of crackers, smoking and polluting the whole city at that time?  or  **Did they light up diyas and have musical celebration in the honour of Lord Rama?**  P.S. - In ""Lord of The Rings - Return of the King"" too, Gandalf did not burst crackers during Aragorn's coronation at Gondor.",General,Positive

"For those of you who are arguing diwali only causes 1-2% of total pollution, I would like to explain with a vague example that 1% of a crore would still be a very high no. And in pretty much the same way when our AQI is already High, even a percentage or two of that makes a lot of impact.  Secondly, idk bout this year but few years ago it was the case that most crackers were made in China. If it's still the case now I wonder ab nationalism kha gya? Bs social media pe show krna hota hai?  Correct me if I'm wrong bout crackers thing but I'm very inclined to believe they r still bought from China.  And let's not forget the amount of indirect animal abuse, soil and noise pollution. There hasn't been one diwali in the last 5 years for me where I hvnt heard of a case jha kisi cow ki tail pe crackers bandh k burn kiye ho.  In the end, we all know we burn cracker bcz of religious bias/ competition in some way. Maybe not all of you but some surely do.

"Well. I happily started celebrating Diwali without fire crackers. Even had impression that it leads to severe pollution. Encourage others for same but never forced others to stop. But then from last few years pollution rise and it stay as it is for like months even way before Diwali arrives and no efforts or action from govt or courts are made to tackle it properly. Liberals keep quite waiting for Diwali to arrive. It did piss me off. While I know bursting crackers will only add to it but specifically banning only crackers that too mainly during Diwali is not acceptable.

I do realise certain improper and mismanaged ways used in farming and how they immensely contribute negatively to the air we breathe in here but pardon me to point out that the 'No farmers No pollution' tag is kinda stupid to put forth. The choice of words is incorrect and the message you might want to put forth doesn't have good enough a bracket. You do realise the consequences of having no famers in a country right!?

I saw Arvind kejriwal came up with some sort of chemicals to remove the stubble of the crop. I feel the need of the hour is to find ways to solve the problems instead of pinning it on farmers. Govt should interfere and come up with lucrative ways to find an alternative and educate the farmers about that method. None of the farmers would want to burn the stubble of there was a cheaper alternate. Only jointly can they resolve the issue.

"I'll suggest to those who have cars that use it only when you and all your family members have to go somewhere together like to relatives home, trip etc.   But when it comes to your daily routine like office, college or the place where you've to go every single day then use public transport as much as possible bcos most of the people comes to their work place alone in their car and that will be one car for one person so it increases the amount cars on to the roads which causes traffic jams everyday which wastes fuel as well as causes more carbon emissions and we all know tht every day there is so much traffic on roads during office hours both at morning and evening.  So the solution to that is :-    1)To use more public transport.  2) Or if you still want to use your car then try to give lift to your office colleagues so that amount of vehicles could be reduced.  3) And also make WFH a choice for an employee.   So I guess that's the realistic way to curb down the pollution level in my perspective bcos we know every day lakhs of vehicles runs on the roads and most of them are office going vehicles. So yeah that's my view on it.",Health/Environment,Positive
"You are correct on your behalf but there's an issue with this also, there is no way possible to get a seat in metro during the peak hours (unless you board at the first station). Also, there is an issue with connectivity. For example I live in uttam nagar(near dwarka) and I have to travel to gurgaon daily. Now cab is really expensive and I am just an intern so I don't have a car. So basically I have no other option than using metro. Even though by road it is close but through metro I have to travel for around 2.5 hours one way. So a person earning 1-2 lakh per month wouldn't take a metro since he can easily afford a vehicle. The only point that stands is car pooling and yes that needs to be followed for sure.",Vehicle Emission,Positive
Yes carpooling especially should be encouraged..but i doubt that if even 10% of the office population that goes in their car suddenly started using public transport will be able to do so. Our transport system is just not ready to handle that much crowd and now especially with the concern of covid always lingering around.

"I cycle easily 20 km daily. With all the traffic and congestion.   Most of the cities are doing it. Making cycling an option for people. We have metro.

Well yes but realistically speaking even if we remove cars then we have to bring some other mode of transport right? Metro? Buses cycles. Electric bikes or just bikes. As far as traffic is concerned well neither people are cooperative nor the govt is active in maintaining strictness. Best they'll do is charge money and best people will do is try not to get charged for traffic rules violation. But cycles are for sure a great potential solution.,Vehicle Emission,Positive
Well its a scam no body wants to stop the people from buying a new stuff which will circulate the money and rich will get more rich and its a cycle...also no one wants to get left behind by not doing what an avg. person is doing to live a more fullfulling life so basically its a difficult transition to make by giving up what you are consuming...then it boils down to find a better alternetive.

"Patience. Yes. Patience.   We want fast solutions. And politicians take advantage of that, give us fast solutions (which don't work, satisfy us for the time being), and then we are in a worse situation coz the real problem wasn't solved, now we have to deal with the new problem (which was the previous solution)  The fact is, after hitting my foot repeatedly, if i ask, why isn't the pain stopping, what is the solution?  We are creating the problem, and want to turn a blind eye to it, but then we don't want the effect.   Whatever comments have said are some form of a solution the politicians have come up with.   No one is picking the root cause.   We are apathetic to nature. If there is summer we close the doors switch on the ac, if it's winter we close the doors and switch on the heater.  When the sky is dull and grey we complain, but when it is nice and starry, we never care to look up.  We are too engulfed in our own benefit, and could not care less about anything else unless it becomes a problem. Then we want to act o so sensitive.   Solutions will come when we see what we do daily. And we want to police everyone else, and not do a single thing ourselves.   The only solution is to become more sensitive and observe our own doing, if we notice our actions are harming what we value, we will automatically change. We need to value what we have.  If you don't seek a park, or a green tree filled area and just listen to the birds, you have no right to talk about taking care of nature. First become a part of nature, then we can see what to do.

Otherwise people were so considerate of each other that they would not have allowed someone with breathing trouble to suffer due to smoke.

As we think of a solution to pollution, we need to look at cities as a whole. A solution would be sustainable and would be applicable too.   1. ¬†The first thing that comes to mind is driving less. This is perhaps the most significant step you can take as an individual to make a difference.   2.    We can also consider carpools, public transportation, and simply walking. ¬†The city    needs to be made more pedestrian friendly, with more green spaces and nicer    pathways.  3.   We need to recycle more, and be more conscious of our consumption patterns. We can    also consider using green energy sources, and use less energy. ¬†The city authorities    must impose more regulations, and more rigor in the implementation of those    regulations.   these are some practical way for this problem.But stilll now we cant guarentee this as a definite solution.but ican helps to reduce the percentage of pollution.",Health/Environment,Positive

Tell one of your close friends about the trip and share the live location. You've already done this. But also keep him/her updated so that he/she can back you up. It's a good idea to say that you have gone to their home or something, especially if the trip is a short duration one. Long duration trips are risky tbh.   2. Telling lies smartly will be the key here. If your parents are smart, they'll maybe ask to speak to your friend. Before the situation arises that you scramble around to find your friend, you instead call them 2-3 times a day yourself, probably with your friend already on the call to give the impression that he is around. You can swiftly do this using the conference call option (in normal call). Parents want updates when you're nit around; this will take care if that.  3. On a more personal note, stay safe. Book good-rated hotels, avoid traveling during nights especially if you're both alone, and use safety for your funny businesses. ;)  Take care and enjoy!",General,Positive

I asked her what the need for even one was. She said they needed it for getting to school and work. But her house is barely 10 minutes from the school on foot and her parents work 20 minutes away.   Instead of investing so much on these road projects, Gov should invest on more metros per line to reduce congestion and rapidly connecting more and more areas. Atleast the environmental impact of that is lower than building highways and then cars running along on them. And to supplement the system, they should also focus on cleaner sources of energy.
