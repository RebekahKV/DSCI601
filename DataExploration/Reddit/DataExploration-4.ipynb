Decomposition takes time (months) and the stubble can’t be left in the field for that time because the field has to be prepared for the next crop.

The farmer greed due to MSP and habit is causing them to grow rice, which we have in excess and each kg of rice needs 500+ L of water.  Now the machines to cut the straw are expensive and not all available at the time of harvest so they burn the crop.  Punjab needs to grow other crops, rice is simply not suitable for this area due to its high water requirements.  The govt made a terrible, corporation motivated attempt without any real alternatives and sudden change with no talks with farmers, so it failed.

Machines that can cut and bale the straw plus fermenting additives for faster natural degradation. 6. Water table recharge. 7. Grow paddy in other area. 8.

Now with newer data and more media presence and info coming from all sectors and worsening pollution way ahead of diwali has brought in more real truth   Also we have to take into account 6 7 yrs back fewer factories was there. More forest coverage everything was better nature wise and hence we saw lesser destruction.  But now the ability of environment to heal on its own is reduced.  So everything and everyone causing pollution has to be blamed equally be it farmers or festivals.\", 'Stubble burning isn’t main cause  Don\\'t watch those news channels, see govt reports yourself. India\\'s Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust and 18% to industries.  The director of Centre for Science and Environment alleged that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers is lobbying \"against the report\" because it is \"inconvenient\" to the automobile industry...  A study in 2016 measured the sources and average levels of various types of air pollution in Delhi.  Of PM2.5 pollution, 38% came from road dust, 20% to vehicles, 12% to domestic fuel burning, and 11% to industrial point sources.  Of PM10 pollution, 56% came from road dust, 10% from concrete batching, 10% from industrial point sources, and 9% from vehicles.  Of NOx emissions, 52% came from industrial point sources (mostly from power plants and 36% from vehicles (but the 36% was potentially more damaging due to being emitted close to people).  Of SO2 emissions, 90% came from industrial point sources. Of CO emissions, 83% came from vehicles.  The large contributions of vehicles and road dust to air pollution have been made worse by court-ordered restrictions on bus service in Delhi, which had the effect of accelerating the purchase of private cars and the construction of roads to accommodate them.

You can deny its impact as much as you want, but the evidence appears every year in front of our eyes, and in hospitals.

During my first winter, I smelt a very strong fragrance in the air which was somehow similar to ripe cardamom (as I vaguely remember from my one time encounter with ripe cardamom during childhood ). I thought some mobile vendor was around the colony, selling ripe cardamom. In the next few winters I had the same experience over and over again. On one occasion I even stumbled upon the fallen flower responsible for the fragrance (and thus realized that it is not the smell of ripe cardamom) but even then my brain never recognized the connection between the time of the year and the fragrance. In 2021 while I was passing through Defence Colony in South Delhi, I got the smell again and it suddenly struck me, \"Wait! I get this smell every year just when winter is approaching\". I asked the cab driver if he recognized the smell and whether this flower blooms only during the advent of winter. He had no clue. Few days ago, I got the smell again. This time, I went around asking my colleagues and friends who were born and brought up in Delhi. All of them are clueless. In other words, none of them has been able to identify the pattern... \"Smell Come, Winter come\". So, just a while ago I did a Google search \"Delhi winter fragrance\" and read an article on Indian Express, attributing the fragrance to saptaparni tree. The next search result was this reddit post. I Googled images of the tree and showed it to my colleagues and all of them are able to identify it, although they are still oblivious to its connection with the advent of winter. The admin officer said to me,\"mere ko toh aisa kabhi mehsus nahin  hua. Leken agar aapko mehsus hua, toh aapka dimaag bariya hai\". I feel smart, and thus, happy lol!

So the solution to that is :-    1)To use more public transport.  2) Or if you still want to use your car then try to give lift to your office colleagues so that amount of vehicles could be reduced.  3) And also make WFH a choice for an employee.   So I guess that's the realistic way to curb down the pollution level in my perspective bcos we know every day lakhs of vehicles runs on the roads and most of them are office going vehicles. So yeah that's my view on it.\", \"You are correct on your behalf but there's an issue with this also, there is no way possible to get a seat in metro during the peak hours (unless you board at the first station). Also, there is an issue with connectivity. For example I live in uttam nagar(near dwarka) and I have to travel to gurgaon daily. Now cab is really expensive and I am just an intern so I don't have a car. So basically I have no other option than using metro. Even though by road it is close but through metro I have to travel for around 2.5 hours one way. So a person earning 1-2 lakh per month wouldn't take a metro since he can easily afford a vehicle. The only point that stands is car pooling and yes that needs to be followed for sure.\", 'Yes carpooling especially should be encouraged..but i doubt that if even 10% of the office population that goes in their car suddenly started using public transport will be able to do so. Our transport system is just not ready to handle that much crowd and now especially with the concern of covid always lingering around. But if infrastructure of public transport is handled well and planned well then it could be a game changer for Delhi', \"I cycle easily 20 km daily. With all the traffic and congestion.   Most of the cities are doing it. Making cycling an option for people. We have metro. Make parking spaces for cycles that are secure and give people the security of knowing that nothing will happen to their cycles. I know people who drive in their cars have a windshield perspective. If you don't know what it is, Google that.  For more information visit r/fuckcars for all the harmful things that cars and everything that is built for cars does to our environment.  Cars need to be discouraged. Just look around when you are out and see how everything is being devoured by cars. How isolating it is to just sit in your car. And I see tons of articles in the newspapers of road rage. People who stay in traffic daily tend to lose control easily and get irritated.\", \"Well yes but realistically speaking even if we remove cars then we have to bring some other mode of transport right? Metro? Buses cycles. Electric bikes or just bikes. As far as traffic is concerned well neither people are cooperative nor the govt is active in maintaining strictness. Best they'll do is charge money and best people will do is try not to get charged for traffic rules violation. But cycles are for sure a great potential solution.\", 'Well its a scam no body wants to stop the people from buying a new stuff which will circulate the money and rich will get more rich and its a cycle...also no one wants to get left behind by not doing what an avg. person is doing to live a more fullfulling life so basically its a difficult transition to make by giving up what you are consuming...then it boils down to find a better alternetive.

And politicians take advantage of that, give us fast solutions (which don't work, satisfy us for the time being), and then we are in a worse situation coz the real problem wasn't solved, now we have to deal with the new problem (which was the previous solution)  The fact is, after hitting my foot repeatedly, if i ask, why isn't the pain stopping, what is the solution?  We are creating the problem, and want to turn a blind eye to it, but then we don't want the effect.   Whatever comments have said are some form of a solution the politicians have come up with.   No one is picking the root cause.   We are apathetic to nature. If there is summer we close the doors switch on the ac, if it's winter we close the doors and switch on the heater.  When the sky is dull and grey we complain, but when it is nice and starry, we never care to look up.  We are too engulfed in our own benefit, and could not care less about anything else unless it becomes a problem. Then we want to act o so sensitive.   Solutions will come when we see what we do daily. And we want to police everyone else, and not do a single thing ourselves.   The only solution is to become more sensitive and observe our own doing, if we notice our actions are harming what we value, we will automatically change. We need to value what we have.  If you don't seek a park, or a green tree filled area and just listen to the birds, you have no right to talk about taking care of nature. First become a part of nature, then we can see what to do.   Harmony with nature is the only solution.\", \">We are too engulfed in our own benefit, and could not care less about anything else unless it becomes a problem. Then we want to act o so sensitive.   True that.  But how do we tell and teach people at a large scale that whatever they're doing is actually slowly killing themselves only.

The parali bit is a small factor local pollution is major factor. Road dust, waste burning, vehicle and industrial exhaust are larger contributors.   Punjab govt since 2014 introduced a policy to limit the ground water consumption so they wanted farmers to plant seeds at a certain time. That leaves a small window to get rid of rice straw. Now this was not a concern before as the rice straw would naturally decompose.  You think farmers want to burn the crop, nope they too breathe this.  The farmer greed due to MSP and habit is causing them to grow rice, which we have in excess and each kg of rice needs 500+ L of water.  Now the machines to cut the straw are expensive and not all available at the time of harvest so they burn the crop.  Punjab needs to grow other crops, rice is simply not suitable for this area due to its high water requirements.  The govt made a terrible, corporation motivated attempt without any real alternatives and sudden change with no talks with farmers, so it failed. Adding the political backlash with the deaths and lack of empathy from the centre.  Parali is a water issue of Punjab.  Solutions  1. Tax rice so its not worth growing. Or cancel msp but with alternatives. 2. Clear MSP much higher for oil seeds which are currently imported. 3. Dialog with farmers. 4. Lottery system to who gets to grow rice. 5. Machines that can cut and bale the straw plus fermenting additives for faster natural degradation. 6. Water table recharge. 7. Grow paddy in other area. 8.

On one occasion I even stumbled upon the fallen flower responsible for the fragrance (and thus realized that it is not the smell of ripe cardamom) but even then my brain never recognized the connection between the time of the year and the fragrance.

I asked the cab driver if he recognized the smell and whether this flower blooms only during the advent of winter. He had no clue. Few days ago, I got the smell again. This time, I went around asking my colleagues and friends who were born and brought up in Delhi. All of them are clueless. In other words, none of them has been able to identify the pattern... \"Smell Come, Winter come\". So, just a while ago I did a Google search \"Delhi winter fragrance\" and read an article on Indian Express, attributing the fragrance to saptaparni tree. The next search result was this reddit post.

So the solution to that is :-    1)To use more public transport.  2) Or if you still want to use your car then try to give lift to your office colleagues so that amount of vehicles could be reduced.  3) And also make WFH a choice for an employee.

Now cab is really expensive and I am just an intern so I don't have a car. So basically I have no other option than using metro. Even though by road it is close but through metro I have to travel for around 2.5 hours one way. So a person earning 1-2 lakh per month wouldn't take a metro since he can easily afford a vehicle.
