The city of Delhi, known for grappling with some of the worst air pollution levels globally, is taking drastic measures to curb the environmental crisis they're facing. The local authorities recently declared a one-week closure of schools and a four-day halt on construction activities to protect citizens from the worsening levels of toxic smog. Additionally, government offices and private businesses have been encouraged to adopt work-from-home arrangements.\n\nWhat caught my eye, in particular, was the discussion around a potential \"**Pollution Lockdown**.\" The idea was suggested by the Supreme Court of India, and the Delhi government, led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), expressed its readiness to implement such a lockdown if necessary. This proposal is seen as an \"extreme step\" by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal but is being considered to safeguard public health. However, it's interesting to note that the federal government opposes this plan, showcasing a divergence in approaches towards managing the pollution crisis between local and federal authorities.\n\nThe notion of a pollution lockdown is quite novel and could set a precedent for other heavily polluted cities across the globe. It brings up several discussion points:\n\n1. What are your thoughts on the concept of a Pollution Lockdown? Is it a viable solution to severe air pollution crises in urban areas?\n2. How might such a lockdown impact the economy and daily life in Delhi and potentially in other cities facing similar issues?\n3. What other measures could be more effective or should be implemented alongside to address the root causes of air pollution?\n4. How does the opposition from the federal government play into the dynamics of environmental governance in India?\n\nI'm keen to hear your insights and engage in a fruitful discussion on this topical issue. The more we discuss and spread awareness about such environmental challenges, the closer we get to finding sustainable solutions.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1698926704.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/17m1yek/exploring_the_idea_of_a_pollution_lockdown_delhis/", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Pollution doesn\u2019t enter inside people\u2019s houses after lockdown?

The Troubling Trend in Delhi", "selftext": "Let's talk about the growing elephant in the room\u2014or should I say, the haze outside our windows. Delhi, a city once known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and mouth-watering street food, is now garnering attention for an entirely different reason: its choking air quality. And in our attempts to adapt, we've unknowingly created a distressing trend\u2014air purifiers are becoming as common as air conditioners. This is not progress; it's a coping mechanism, and it's not one we should be accepting.\n\nBack in the day, as temperatures soared, we turned to air conditioners for solace. It was an appliance of comfort, of luxury. Fast forward to today and what do we have? Air purifiers have gone from being a niche product to an absolute necessity for many households in Delhi. But here's the kicker: while an AC was an answer to Mother Nature's heat, the air purifier is our answer to a problem we have created ourselves.\n\nThe normalization of air purifiers is not just about spending money on another appliance. It's the sad acceptance of the fact that the air we breathe\u2014the very essence of life\u2014is no longer safe. Every time you hear the hum of an air purifier, it's a reminder of the trees we cut, the cars we drive without restraint, the industries that spew pollutants unchecked, and the collective apathy we've shown towards our environment.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the companies capitalizing on our misery. Of course, there's a market now! Because, when you can't breathe outside, you turn inside, right? The marketing of these machines is slick: \"Breathe pure, stay healthy,\" they say. But isn't it ironic? We shouldn't need machines to promise us clean air. It's our birthright, not a luxury item.\n\nFurthermore, relying on air purifiers lulls us into a false sense of security. We think, \"Oh, I've got an air purifier, I'm safe.\" But what about when we step outside? What about the millions who can't afford these machines? Are they any less deserving of clean air?\n\nWe shouldn't be adapting to pollution. We should be fighting it. Air purifiers are a band-aid solution to a gaping wound. Delhi's air crisis should be a wake-up call, not an opportunity to introduce a new home appliance into our lives.\n\nSo, the next time someone talks about their new air purifier, let it be a reminder\u2014not of the smart purchase they made, but of the environment we're ruining. Let's not make air purifiers the new norm.

And I'm super anxious about the pollution wave that will inevitably come with the cold winds.\n\nIn my honest opinion, a lot of people don't bother about something that does not causes issues to people immediately.  Same goes in the case of pollution, a lot of people aren't bothered about the pollution much. They're fine breathing it directly disregarding the long term damage that the pollution is doing (I'm no expert on how much the damage it will do, but I'm pretty sure that it could cause issues to a person in someway. Long-term exposure to polluted air can have permanent health effects such as: Accelerated aging of the lungs. Loss of lung capacity and decreased lung function.)\n\nSo with this post, I wanted to seek help from the people of Delhi about the ways for avoiding air pollution and keeping yourself safe. People might argue that post-covid everyone is aware of n95 masks so just wear them, but I'm concerned about the efficiency of those masks to block the air pollution. The seal around the face of an N95 mask/respirator is NOT completely airtight when it is properly fitted and seated. There is always some area where the air can leak (Naturally, matters takes the path of least resistance, so the amount of polluted air intake would be significantly greater than that of the filtered air.)  \n\n\nWith all that, It makes me wonder if someone have found an economical and an efficient way of curbing the air pollution in Delhi.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1697537748.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/179v14g/aqi_in_delhi_a_discussion_about_the_air_pollution/", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 6, "comments": [{"body": "Hey OP...

Wearing of masks :- properly fitting N99 respirators with filters changed in adequate intervals are the best, N95 which are fitting properly and not drenched in sweat are also okay (moderate evidence, strong recommendation)  \n6.

I purchased my filter after asking nearly 3-5 personal friends , reading reviews , watching YouTube videos. \nWhen I got my device it turns out it has a standard pleated AC filter like the one used in US central AC systems in the Air Return duct. \n\nNow if you want rough filteration you get washable filters.

Check the number 1500 on the filter. That's a MERV rating. Higher the number better the filter. I used to use 2200 MERV\n \nHere in India I have a Philips air purifier essentially it's the similar pleated filter plus an activated carbon filter. This filter removes gases in the air. Activated carbon is cheap in bulk . In this filter they have small half inch hexagons in a plastic frame about 4-5 mm thick on both sides there is a thin plastic mesh. Each hexagon contains 5-6 granules. Air passing over the granules gets some of the dangerous gasses absorbed in the activated carbon granules. After some time it looses effectiveness.  The granules themselves are damm cheap probably worth less than Rs20 , the plastic case probably Rs 100 in retail cost. But Philips sells it for Rs1200. If some one can find a way to refill that case or make a similar one which is refillable it will be great. \n\nI'm not sure how the pleated filters are made but an washable filter before the pleated filter will make the filter last much more especially if you wash it every day. \n\nThe pleated filter costs 3000 and gets clogged in just 2-3 weeks for a medium sized room running only for the night. \n\nIf one has these pleated filters, and the carbon filter all that one needs is a fan which makes low noise. \nIt's isn't a big deal to make this kind of thing. \n\nMain thing is managing the consumables.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1637780143.0, "reply": [], "author": "Life_Percentage_2218", "id": "hlxnc01", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_r11062"}, {"body": "Pro Tip: clean it on the pot, won't have to wipe down the entire bathroom.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1637785120.0, "reply": [], "author": "justadoofus98", "id": "hlxzys4", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_r11062"}, {"body": "This reminds me I need to get my MI purifier out.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1637788519.0, "reply": [], "author": "Rockfella27", "id": "hly8jv9", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_r11062"}, {"body": "Dude, Delhi is fucked!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1637789340.0, "reply": [], "author": "Equinoxx9", "id": "hlyakq2", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_r11062"}, {"body": "Weeks!!!!

During the Mughal era, Deepavali was celebrated primarily using lamps; and, to a very limited extent restricted to the Gujarat area, illuminative fireworks.
