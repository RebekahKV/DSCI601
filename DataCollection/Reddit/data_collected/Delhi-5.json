Naive western tourist here \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI will be in Visakhapatnam for a week for a wedding, coming from Europe. Since I have never been to India I figured I'd try to find a tour group to see some more places beyond just where the wedding is, so found an 8 day tour that goes around the typical tourist \"golden triangle\" route from Delhi to Agra to Jaipur then back to Delhi. I know there are better places to see but this was the only tour I found that worked for my dates with the wedding.\n\nBut with the air quality I am considering just cancelling the golden triangle tour altogether. Is it safe to assume the air quality will be just as bad in 3 weeks? The tour will only have us in Delhi for 2 nights. Will the areas around Agra and Jaipur be just as bad?\n\nCan the worst of the air quality be avoided mostly in the South of India?\n\nI tend to really, really struggle with bad air quality and even have a tough time when AQI is over 100, so obviously am a bit alarmed at the prospect of an AQI of 500+. \n\nThank you in advance.", "score": 238, "created_utc": 1699195895.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/17odj8m/should_i_cancel_my_trip_to_delhi_due_to_air/", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Even people who live in Delhi are trying to leave, would strongly advice against visiting right now.", "score": 231, "created_utc": 1699196724.0, "reply": [{"body": "Is mid-January usually better?", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1702106539.0, "author": "AmericanBornWuhaner", "id": "kclvm4g", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t1_k7xnaoz"}], "author": "Hisokaskneecap", "id": "k7xnaoz", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_17odj8m"}, {"body": "Your eyes will pain throat will get sour and the visibility will be only few meters  so please avoid", "score": 94, "created_utc": 1699198928.0, "reply": [], "author": "Old_Application_5722", "id": "k7xt1mi", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_17odj8m"}, {"body": "Dude please just go to the Andaman\u2019s, havelock island to be precise.

Reach out to enthusiast groups on FB, see what the pros in your field are doing on YouTube, do problems from 2-3+ grades above you if it's maths, physics, etc. Whatever you pick up shouldn't dishearten you, it's just important that you find next thing that you can aim for.\nThis is applicable for everyone, but often it's the gifted kids that miss out developing to their full potential because of how easily there could be nobody to guide them.

Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.\r  \n\r  \nAn alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment. Biological accumulation in nearby fishes and crops also occur as all these heavy metal particulate matter settle down in to soil and get absorbed.\r  \n\r  \nComposition of pollutants due to parali or stubble burning is mainly black carbon, which also have serious adverse effects in the long run.\r  \n\r  \nArea under the curve can help you to find the total contribution by of these several sources of air pollution .\r  \n\r  \nLink to study: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101428 Study conducted by IIT Delhi .\n\nI'm in no way saying that stubble burning is not a big problem or that stubble burning is forgivable.

Break ups suck. Im going through one too.

I read your comments- you feel like she was your only one, you will never be able to love again and the pain would never end. So, a couple points that might help you: \n1. Most people feel this way after a break up (especially if its your first).\n2. It\u2019s scientifically proven that human beings fall in love multiple times with multiple people.\n3. Once you start detaching yourself from the break up (which takes time) you will start to realise things that were wrong with the relationship\n4. If you heal in a right way, chances are you will move on to a better and healthier relationship than your last.\n5. After a while, nobody really regrets the break up. They mostly never want to go back to their ex- partner\n6. Break ups are a time of transformation.

I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:\n\n1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.\n\n2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.\n\n3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc. \n\nPolice lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.\n\nBut what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.\n\nEarlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors. They are happy that protestors were repressed because it's one less problem for them.\n\nSo now if you are an educated middle class person upset with pollution what do you do?

Wearing N95 mask is more or less mandatory for people like me along with inhaler and a bunch of medications. Near my apartent, it smells all the time like someone has just burst crackers.  And I have to request uber drivers to pull the windows up everytime and some of them leave gaps in the window so I have to request them a few more times. As per doctors, being out in the open in these winter months is like smoking packs of cigarettes. Asthma, bronchitis, even cancer in the long term are on the rise. How are people living like this, inhaling poison everyday. The permissible AQI is 100 if I am not wrong, what the hell is 500? It is just ridiculous. Most of the population either don't care or have gotten used to it (\"thik hai chalta hai, itna ro mat etc.\"). The government pretends to do something about it but doesn't do anything effective. And why should it care if most people are okay with living like this. On a lighter note, our CM has to attend ED summons due to the liquor scam case, and his right hand is in jail. I don't think this is a very difficult problem to solve and there are many capable people in the country/government who can find a solution. But somehow we are okay with - thik hai chalne do...

It's a bit harder to breathe but The trick is not to push past the aerobic pace and stay in z1 or z2 zone at max. If you've been running regularly and have a better aerobic base than the average Joe then you should be fine within those limits. Poor aqi and high pm2.5 particles in air start adversely affecting your lungs after one hour only so you should keep your running time under it. To know you are staying at an easy aerobic jogging pace, breathe through nostrils and if you feel you need to breathe through mouth know that you're running at an unwanted higher pace so avoid that and you will be fine. Look its better to go out and work the lungs instead of sitting on your ass and munching on food. When your goal is to be fit, something is always better than nothing no matter what anyone says. You will not breathe any cleaner air in and around your house anyway so don't let the aqi number get to your head. At the end of the day everyone is at a different level so do it and see how it feels instead of asking folks that don't do any running at all. Gand daba ke baithnewale gyan chodenge duniya bhar ka.

Tell one of your close friends about the trip and share the live location. You've already done this. But also keep him/her updated so that he/she can back you up. It's a good idea to say that you have gone to their home or something, especially if the trip is a short duration one. Long duration trips are risky tbh. \n\n2. Telling lies smartly will be the key here. If your parents are smart, they'll maybe ask to speak to your friend.

But I seriously think that we've reached the point of no return. I mean yes, the crop burning is a major contributor to the bad AQI. But so is the amount of construction, cars on road and other such activities. \n\nI speak from the perspective of a cyclist. I bike on a daily basis and would gladly commute by a cycle or walk or take the metro. But after a 100K ride in the shitty air, I developed a bad cold and can't manage to get back on my cycle. And I can't ride in the afternoon/evening hours either because of the insane amount of traffic since every Tom, Dick and Harry feel the need to buy an Innova or Thar or Fortuner just to transport a single person. For fuck's sake if you go 30KMs in any direction from Central Delhi, you'll be out of Delhi. That's how small this place is. We have an amazing metro infra. Why do people still need two cars in every household? \n\nThe issue is that we can't stop this. Clearly the government, no matter which party leads it, has been bought out by the car and construction industry, who want it to keep on engaging in worthless construction. Why can't we spend more on strengthening the current public transport system and reducing the amount of traffic on roads instead of building highways and bypasses which will also get clogged up soon due to the amount of cars on road?  \n\nBut then haven't we already gone too far? We can't take down all the empty, dead high rises and malls in places like Gurgaon. We can't demolish all the highways and make all the cars disappear. We were never meant to go down this path but we did. And now there's no going back. The AQI will keep getting worse. The water will keep getting dirtier... Yamuna is already full of crap no matter how much we talk about cleaning it. It sounds pessimistic but I don't think we're going to be able to change anything now. We've pretty much reached the point of no return. And it'll just be worse for our kids.

Atleast the environmental impact of that is lower than building highways and then cars running along on them.
