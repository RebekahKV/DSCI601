Heck small town doctors tell seniors to stay indoors on Diwali night. Even before all this, Indian media gave the industry a fair bit of scrutiny because of child labour in Sivakasi and the number of children who used to die in those sweatshops every year. Media awareness worked and TN government got child labour under control. The era of cheap crackers was over but this was generally seen as a good thing. Solutions can happen when people stop raging against imagined straw men.\n\nEnvironmental science research and activism was behind the court orders that led to first solution that was implemented to combat air pollution in Delhi, the shut down and cancellation of further expansion at the Badarpur coal-fired power station. Other big policy moves led to Delhi having a large share of CNG vehicles in public transit and cabs.

Most of the population either don't care or have gotten used to it (\"thik hai chalta hai, itna ro mat etc.\"). The government pretends to do something about it but doesn't do anything effective.

Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.\r  \n\r  \nAn alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment. Biological accumulation in nearby fishes and crops also occur as all these heavy metal particulate matter settle down in to soil and get absorbed.\r  \n\r  \nComposition of pollutants due to parali or stubble burning is mainly black carbon, which also have serious adverse effects in the long run.\r  \n\r  \nArea under the curve can help you to find the total contribution by of these several sources of air pollution .\r  \n\r  \nLink to study: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101428 Study conducted by IIT Delhi .\n\nI'm in no way saying that stubble burning is not a big problem or that stubble burning is forgivable.

RTI - one can easily Google how to file a RTI to get information on measures taken for air pollution, amount of money spent (or not)\n\n2. Write emails: to relevant authorities and people. All such email IDs can be found on government websites. Start with CM Delhi, copy all national and international authorities. I would go to the extent of copying a WHO official, since this is a public health crisis. \n\n3. What happened to the air pollution ordinances, bills and laws? Seek information, see where the money went and go the legal route. Air purifying towers worth xyz crores were installed (in certain posh localities) - why and what happened to that? Was that a scientific approach? Gimmick? \n\nAsk questions people.

Those who don\u2019t see value in it don\u2019t understand why others do. And that\u2019s fair we don\u2019t have to care about everything that everybody else cares about. I hope to actually engage with this here, so I\u2019ll say why I like burning firecrackers. \n\nWhy is Diwali such a significant festival for us? How is it different from Navratri? Or from Raksha Bandhan? If you agree that Diwali is celebrated with more zeal than others (maybe Holi comes close), if it is a \u201cbada tyohaar\u201d as compared to others, why? Most other elements of Diwali are present in some form in all these festivals, right? Gifts, prayers, family, friends, f oliv, shopping are all common\u2026 Lights and firecrackers are the unique ones. For me, it is because of these. Because as a kid I grew up knowing \u201cDiwali pe patakhe fodenge\u201d.  I used to look forward to it. Had my \u201cstash\u201d ready a couple days before lol.  And that\u2019s why Holi is also so significant. These are the 2 festivals where kids get to \u201cdo fun stuff\u201d.  That\u2019s what captures our imaginations as kids. Doing fun stuff. For most of us adults, things are more introspective and so are festivals but kids are different. \n\nI am under no illusions that bursting firecrackers causes serious environmental issues. Pollution levels rise. Heavy metal concentrations increase. Noise pollution and all kinds of other nuisances are all fair considerations. But *on the balance of things*, it seems to be acceptable for a day, in moderation, *to me*. \n\nWhy? Because it is not a fuck you to others or to the government. It is not a political or religious statement at all. It is not even rational (although I can rationalise it). It is personal. It is trying to recapture that little nostalgic sense of childhood joy, the apprehension of lighting the fuse, the anticipation as it fizzes along and the final payoff of the loud bang or the colours in the sky. It is my slice of festive happiness, for just one day a year. Every other day, 2/3 of of all my waking hours, I\u2019m \u201cHuman Resource\u201d, solving bullshit problems for bullshit people. For these 2-3 hours of Diwali evening I\u2019m a person trying to relive some of the best moments of my childhood. Over the years, increasingly, the number and intensity of the firecrackers I burst has dropped. Yesterday I had a packet of \u201cbijlee bombs\u201d that me and friends would light periodically in the middle of reminiscing old stories of our childhood Diwali shenanigans. We got more introspective. Now if I don\u2019t light these and just have the conversation it wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss. But if those stories didn\u2019t exist at all? If the sky shot had never gone through the basketball hoop, some of the Diwali magic would be lost. And with enough of that, I feel we\u2019d lose Diwali as it is in our hearts and minds. And the world would be slightly more depressing than it already is. \n\nThat\u2019s a fairly personal account though. Everyone has their own motivations. We can discuss the actual \u201clogical\u201d questions around the practice but we\u2019d have to define an inflection point, when should our general considerations toward fellow people who may be *indirectly* affected by our actions outweigh our freedom to carry them out? Would we ban joyrides and road trips on the same \u201cpollution\u201d principle? \n\nI may be selfish here, to weigh my happiness more than others\u2019 unhappiness but then, I doubt there will be many people who wouldn\u2019t find such \u201cselfishness\u201d intrinsic in things they do all the time too. I\u2019m not claiming to be right here. Objectively speaking, Diwali itself is a practice in excess. Excess expenditure, excess energy wasted, excess food, excess pollution, excess stress. Question is, whether it is worth it. For me, it is.\n\nTldr: Crackers bad but not that bad.", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1699869505.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/17u7e4z/on_the_firecracker_thing/", "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "Summary: Hum to patakhe phodenge BC, jisko nahi pasand g*nd marao.", "score": 16, "created_utc": 1699870224.0, "reply": [], "author": "Middle-Pizza4886", "id": "k91szgs", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t3_17u7e4z"}, {"body": "You can't explain anything to people who have a thick head bro, so nevermind.\nI posted that as per IIT-D research, pollution from crackers nullifies within 12h, and some chutiya replied being a hero that oh the AQI was 200 at 4 P.M. and now it's 1000.

I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:\n\n1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.\n\n2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.\n\n3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc. \n\nPolice lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.\n\nBut what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.\n\nEarlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors.

I bike on a daily basis and would gladly commute by a cycle or walk or take the metro. But after a 100K ride in the shitty air, I developed a bad cold and can't manage to get back on my cycle. And I can't ride in the afternoon/evening hours either because of the insane amount of traffic since every Tom, Dick and Harry feel the need to buy an Innova or Thar or Fortuner just to transport a single person. For fuck's sake if you go 30KMs in any direction from Central Delhi, you'll be out of Delhi. That's how small this place is. We have an amazing metro infra. Why do people still need two cars in every household? \n\nThe issue is that we can't stop this. Clearly the government, no matter which party leads it, has been bought out by the car and construction industry, who want it to keep on engaging in worthless construction. Why can't we spend more on strengthening the current public transport system and reducing the amount of traffic on roads instead of building highways and bypasses which will also get clogged up soon due to the amount of cars on road?  \n\nBut then haven't we already gone too far? We can't take down all the empty, dead high rises and malls in places like Gurgaon. We can't demolish all the highways and make all the cars disappear. We were never meant to go down this path but we did. And now there's no going back. The AQI will keep getting worse. The water will keep getting dirtier... Yamuna is already full of crap no matter how much we talk about cleaning it. It sounds pessimistic but I don't think we're going to be able to change anything now.

If you've been running regularly and have a better aerobic base than the average Joe then you should be fine within those limits. Poor aqi and high pm2.5 particles in air start adversely affecting your lungs after one hour only so you should keep your running time under it. To know you are staying at an easy aerobic jogging pace, breathe through nostrils and if you feel you need to breathe through mouth know that you're running at an unwanted higher pace so avoid that and you will be fine. Look its better to go out and work the lungs instead of sitting on your ass and munching on food. When your goal is to be fit, something is always better than nothing no matter what anyone says. You will not breathe any cleaner air in and around your house anyway so don't let the aqi number get to your head.
