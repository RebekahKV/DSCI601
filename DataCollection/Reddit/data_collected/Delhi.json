If doctors' and Google's statements are accurate, I'm uncertain how many people may develop such diseases. Looking for solutions suggests staying indoors and going outside only when essential, with the use of original N99 masks. However, not everyone can remain confined to their homes for extended periods, and obtaining and affording original masks is a challenge for many. Consequently, the dilemma arises \u2013 should we venture outside and inhale toxic air? I find it puzzling that if this is a significant threat, why isn't the government taking effective action?

And I'm super anxious about the pollution wave that will inevitably come with the cold winds.\n\nIn my honest opinion, a lot of people don't bother about something that does not causes issues to people immediately.  Same goes in the case of pollution, a lot of people aren't bothered about the pollution much. They're fine breathing it directly disregarding the long term damage that the pollution is doing (I'm no expert on how much the damage it will do, but I'm pretty sure that it could cause issues to a person in someway. Long-term exposure to polluted air can have permanent health effects such as: Accelerated aging of the lungs. Loss of lung capacity and decreased lung function.)\n\nSo with this post, I wanted to seek help from the people of Delhi about the ways for avoiding air pollution and keeping yourself safe. People might argue that post-covid everyone is aware of n95 masks so just wear them, but I'm concerned about the efficiency of those masks to block the air pollution. The seal around the face of an N95 mask/respirator is NOT completely airtight when it is properly fitted and seated. There is always some area where the air can leak (Naturally, matters takes the path of least resistance, so the amount of polluted air intake would be significantly greater than that of the filtered air.)  \n\n\nWith all that, It makes me wonder if someone have found an economical and an efficient way of curbing the air pollution in Delhi.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1697537748.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/179v14g/aqi_in_delhi_a_discussion_about_the_air_pollution/", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 6, "comments": [{"body": "Hey OP... I can point you towards the best resources to answer this question. There is a team of scientists from IIT-Delhi and AIIMS Delhi called as CAPHER India. You can follow them and their research work.

While Dr. Sagnik Dey is not a medical doctor, he has also worked a lot in this area.   \nI'll enumerate the measures which have been advised by the stalwarts:-  \n1. Stay indoors during early morning and late evening (Moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation),\n\n2. Cleaning of indoor air (Air purifiers have Low quality evidence, weak recommendation; HEPA filters have moderate quality of evidence and strong recommendation) \n\n3. Avoid vigorous and extended outdoor activity during peaks of air pollution (low quality of evidence,  weak recommendation). Breath through nose as much as possible.  \n4. Avoid environments near main roads and traffic. Avoid travelling by road, use metro instead (No evidence, weak recommendation)  \n5. Wearing of masks :- properly fitting N99 respirators with filters changed in adequate intervals are the best, N95 which are fitting properly and not drenched in sweat are also okay (moderate evidence, strong recommendation)  \n6.

I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:\n\n1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.\n\n2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.\n\n3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc. \n\nPolice lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.\n\nBut what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.\n\nEarlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors. They are happy that protestors were repressed because it's one less problem for them.\n\nSo now if you are an educated middle class person upset with pollution what do you do?

Air pollution masks are distributed for respiratory health, and the Even-Odd Policy is reinstated to cut vehicular emissions and road congestion. These measures showcase Delhi's dedication to a healthier environment.\n\nFound a detailed breakdown of the same here- [https://thebusinessrule.com/the-smog-problem-of-delhi-the-actions-taken-by-government/](https://thebusinessrule.com/the-smog-problem-of-delhi-the-actions-taken-by-government/)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1700655321.0, "reply": [{"body": "Thank you.

But I seriously think that we've reached the point of no return. I mean yes, the crop burning is a major contributor to the bad AQI. But so is the amount of construction, cars on road and other such activities. \n\nI speak from the perspective of a cyclist. I bike on a daily basis and would gladly commute by a cycle or walk or take the metro. But after a 100K ride in the shitty air, I developed a bad cold and can't manage to get back on my cycle. And I can't ride in the afternoon/evening hours either because of the insane amount of traffic since every Tom, Dick and Harry feel the need to buy an Innova or Thar or Fortuner just to transport a single person. For fuck's sake if you go 30KMs in any direction from Central Delhi, you'll be out of Delhi. That's how small this place is. We have an amazing metro infra. Why do people still need two cars in every household? \n\nThe issue is that we can't stop this. Clearly the government, no matter which party leads it, has been bought out by the car and construction industry, who want it to keep on engaging in worthless construction. Why can't we spend more on strengthening the current public transport system and reducing the amount of traffic on roads instead of building highways and bypasses which will also get clogged up soon due to the amount of cars on road?  \n\nBut then haven't we already gone too far? We can't take down all the empty, dead high rises and malls in places like Gurgaon. We can't demolish all the highways and make all the cars disappear. We were never meant to go down this path but we did. And now there's no going back. The AQI will keep getting worse. The water will keep getting dirtier... Yamuna is already full of crap no matter how much we talk about cleaning it. It sounds pessimistic but I don't think we're going to be able to change anything now.

RTI - one can easily Google how to file a RTI to get information on measures taken for air pollution, amount of money spent (or not)\n\n2. Write emails: to relevant authorities and people. All such email IDs can be found on government websites. Start with CM Delhi, copy all national and international authorities. I would go to the extent of copying a WHO official, since this is a public health crisis. \n\n3. What happened to the air pollution ordinances, bills and laws? Seek information, see where the money went and go the legal route. Air purifying towers worth xyz crores were installed (in certain posh localities) - why and what happened to that? Was that a scientific approach? Gimmick? \n\nAsk questions people.

Wearing N95 mask is more or less mandatory for people like me along with inhaler and a bunch of medications. Near my apartent, it smells all the time like someone has just burst crackers.  And I have to request uber drivers to pull the windows up everytime and some of them leave gaps in the window so I have to request them a few more times. As per doctors, being out in the open in these winter months is like smoking packs of cigarettes. Asthma, bronchitis, even cancer in the long term are on the rise. How are people living like this, inhaling poison everyday. The permissible AQI is 100 if I am not wrong, what the hell is 500? It is just ridiculous. Most of the population either don't care or have gotten used to it (\"thik hai chalta hai, itna ro mat etc.\"). The government pretends to do something about it but doesn't do anything effective. And why should it care if most people are okay with living like this. On a lighter note, our CM has to attend ED summons due to the liquor scam case, and his right hand is in jail. I don't think this is a very difficult problem to solve and there are many capable people in the country/government who can find a solution. But somehow we are okay with - thik hai chalne do...

The city of Delhi, known for grappling with some of the worst air pollution levels globally, is taking drastic measures to curb the environmental crisis they're facing. The local authorities recently declared a one-week closure of schools and a four-day halt on construction activities to protect citizens from the worsening levels of toxic smog. Additionally, government offices and private businesses have been encouraged to adopt work-from-home arrangements.\n\nWhat caught my eye, in particular, was the discussion around a potential \"**Pollution Lockdown**.\" The idea was suggested by the Supreme Court of India, and the Delhi government, led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), expressed its readiness to implement such a lockdown if necessary. This proposal is seen as an \"extreme step\" by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal but is being considered to safeguard public health. However, it's interesting to note that the federal government opposes this plan, showcasing a divergence in approaches towards managing the pollution crisis between local and federal authorities.\n\nThe notion of a pollution lockdown is quite novel and could set a precedent for other heavily polluted cities across the globe. It brings up several discussion points:\n\n1. What are your thoughts on the concept of a Pollution Lockdown? Is it a viable solution to severe air pollution crises in urban areas?\n2. How might such a lockdown impact the economy and daily life in Delhi and potentially in other cities facing similar issues?\n3. What other measures could be more effective or should be implemented alongside to address the root causes of air pollution?\n4. How does the opposition from the federal government play into the dynamics of environmental governance in India?\n\nI'm keen to hear your insights and engage in a fruitful discussion on this topical issue.

Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.\r  \n\r  \nAn alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment. Biological accumulation in nearby fishes and crops also occur as all these heavy metal particulate matter settle down in to soil and get absorbed.\r  \n\r  \nComposition of pollutants due to parali or stubble burning is mainly black carbon, which also have serious adverse effects in the long run.\r  \n\r  \nArea under the curve can help you to find the total contribution by of these several sources of air pollution .\r  \n\r  \nLink to study: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101428 Study conducted by IIT Delhi .\n\nI'm in no way saying that stubble burning is not a big problem or that stubble burning is forgivable.

The copper heat pipes on my GPU were exceptionally black. After I was reminded of this, I just randomly searched for 'cleaning old GPUs' on YouTube, and lo and behold I found a video cleaning an 11 year old Graphics card, and the copper heat pipes were all looking very much like copper and not black like my graphics card's, which I had only bought in 2017.

I obviously can't be sure, but I'm skeptical as it happened twice, and because my computer case has a lot of fans that suck in a lot of air, air that is very polluted.

I suppose air pollution as been a problem for so long people have come unsensitized.  Another reason is I think the Chinese government purposely undermines the pollution problem through censorship, so people do not get upset at the govt, etc.  Some famous documentaries about the danger of air pollution have been blocked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that point, I am interested  in how the people in a democratic/place with less censorship and EVEN WORSE pollution than China view the air pollution problem.  I see nearly every day air quality levels are extremely extremely poor, makes China's air look great.  What is the attitude of the average Delhi citizen? Do people even check the air quality, wear N95 masks, use air purifiers, make an effort to protect themselves?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a foreigner in China, I got quite frustrated at the lack of care from Chinese people about the pollution.

It takes 3k/hector(might be wrong there) for them to hire additional help to quickly remove the stems that are left behind.

Remember, they are inhaling the fumes first.\n4. Possible way out? the south way. Farmers should be given MSP on other less water intensive crops, such as dals etc. \n5.

whole situation.\nAgriculture has been there for millennia. Tractor came around half a century ago. People managed their crop waste, maybe by burning or they had enough labour to help remove it. There were less source of other air pollution so effect of stubble burning was not that prominent. But point is most probably this practice of burning stubble is there for centuries.  \n\nWhy are farmers to be blamed for the practice which they have been doing for centuries? It's part of their agricultural practice to keep their land fertile, so they'll do it.\n\nWhy are we expecting them to be considerate when we ourselves need a bike to get milk from 500m. When we need AC cab instead of public transport to get to our destination. Why should only farmer who is burning their skin in all weather be considerate towards environment? Why can't general population understand their own responsibilities towards environment? Farmers are easy scapegoat, koi chahiye blame krne ko jldi se dhoondho, lo mil gye farmers ab 2 mahine inhe gaali dekr apni responsibility towards environment poori krenge and then vahi saal bhar pollution felayenge. \n\nFarmers ko koi shauk nahi to destroy nature, instead they live in nature and understand its importance better than us city people. As demand rose for more production, more land started to be used for agriculture. But govt didn't help them to cope up with these demands by providing enough tools to efficiently grow and switch between the crops. They did what they had to do which is super bad for environment, but just like we choose our convenience of car over public transport, they choose their convenience. Car is just an example here, I am calling out our hypocrisy for blaming farmers and refraining from our own duties towards environment.\n\nBlame the govt and ask them question. This problem didn't start in the last decade, it was there all along but now we are seeing the drastic effect. I bet you that environment will never be a priority of any political party. They will ignore it until the situation is like April 2021. Even then they will just do a patch work, why because these dadaji tauji typs politicians have lived most of their life in fresh air. They won't be around to suffer when situation become much worse, we will and our kids will. \n\nYou won't get Hindu Rashtra or good education and health, if there's no livable planet anymore.

You are right ki farmers ki farmers ko shauk nahi h nature destroy ka because they don\u2019t even know the impact caused by them.

Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.\r  \n\r  \nAn alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment. Biological accumulation in nearby fishes and crops also occur as all these heavy metal particulate matter settle down in to soil and get absorbed.\r  \n\r  \nComposition of pollutants due to parali or stubble burning is mainly black carbon, which also have serious adverse effects in the long run.\r  \n\r  \nArea under the curve can help you to find the total contribution by of these several sources of air pollution .\r  \n\r  \nLink to study: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101428 Study conducted by IIT Delhi .\n\nI'm in no way saying that stubble burning is not a big problem or that stubble burning is forgivable.

RTI - one can easily Google how to file a RTI to get information on measures taken for air pollution, amount of money spent (or not)\n\n2. Write emails: to relevant authorities and people. All such email IDs can be found on government websites. Start with CM Delhi, copy all national and international authorities. I would go to the extent of copying a WHO official, since this is a public health crisis. \n\n3. What happened to the air pollution ordinances, bills and laws? Seek information, see where the money went and go the legal route. Air purifying towers worth xyz crores were installed (in certain posh localities) - why and what happened to that? Was that a scientific approach? Gimmick? \n\nAsk questions people.

I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:\n\n1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.\n\n2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.\n\n3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc. \n\nPolice lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.\n\nBut what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.\n\nEarlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors. They are happy that protestors were repressed because it's one less problem for them.\n\nSo now if you are an educated middle class person upset with pollution what do you do? Probably too scared to organise a protest. Even if you organize one others are afraid to come.

But I seriously think that we've reached the point of no return. I mean yes, the crop burning is a major contributor to the bad AQI. But so is the amount of construction, cars on road and other such activities. \n\nI speak from the perspective of a cyclist. I bike on a daily basis and would gladly commute by a cycle or walk or take the metro. But after a 100K ride in the shitty air, I developed a bad cold and can't manage to get back on my cycle. And I can't ride in the afternoon/evening hours either because of the insane amount of traffic since every Tom, Dick and Harry feel the need to buy an Innova or Thar or Fortuner just to transport a single person. For fuck's sake if you go 30KMs in any direction from Central Delhi, you'll be out of Delhi. That's how small this place is. We have an amazing metro infra. Why do people still need two cars in every household? \n\nThe issue is that we can't stop this. Clearly the government, no matter which party leads it, has been bought out by the car and construction industry, who want it to keep on engaging in worthless construction. Why can't we spend more on strengthening the current public transport system and reducing the amount of traffic on roads instead of building highways and bypasses which will also get clogged up soon due to the amount of cars on road?  \n\nBut then haven't we already gone too far? We can't take down all the empty, dead high rises and malls in places like Gurgaon. We can't demolish all the highways and make all the cars disappear. We were never meant to go down this path but we did. And now there's no going back. The AQI will keep getting worse. The water will keep getting dirtier... Yamuna is already full of crap no matter how much we talk about cleaning it. It sounds pessimistic but I don't think we're going to be able to change anything now.

And I have to request uber drivers to pull the windows up everytime and some of them leave gaps in the window so I have to request them a few more times. As per doctors, being out in the open in these winter months is like smoking packs of cigarettes. Asthma, bronchitis, even cancer in the long term are on the rise. How are people living like this, inhaling poison everyday. The permissible AQI is 100 if I am not wrong, what the hell is 500? It is just ridiculous. Most of the population either don't care or have gotten used to it (\"thik hai chalta hai, itna ro mat etc.\"). The government pretends to do something about it but doesn't do anything effective. And why should it care if most people are okay with living like this. On a lighter note, our CM has to attend ED summons due to the liquor scam case, and his right hand is in jail.

It's a bit harder to breathe but The trick is not to push past the aerobic pace and stay in z1 or z2 zone at max. If you've been running regularly and have a better aerobic base than the average Joe then you should be fine within those limits. Poor aqi and high pm2.5 particles in air start adversely affecting your lungs after one hour only so you should keep your running time under it. To know you are staying at an easy aerobic jogging pace, breathe through nostrils and if you feel you need to breathe through mouth know that you're running at an unwanted higher pace so avoid that and you will be fine. Look its better to go out and work the lungs instead of sitting on your ass and munching on food. When your goal is to be fit, something is always better than nothing no matter what anyone says. You will not breathe any cleaner air in and around your house anyway so don't let the aqi number get to your head. At the end of the day everyone is at a different level so do it and see how it feels instead of asking folks that don't do any running at all. Gand daba ke baithnewale gyan chodenge duniya bhar ka.

Be it crop burning or poorly implemented emission standards on factories. However, the results are clear. Tormented psychological and physical health. People in power have no interest and probably it has become the onus of young people to deliver a revolution that might serve, if not ours, but our children's health. Hence, I seek to stir and motivate the young (below 30) to fight for our rights and make the responsible take this seriously, cause no one else might. Let's just stand every day and march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan till we see a drop below 100, because this is completely an actionable problem. Close Delhi. Revolt. We might just be enough. Further, It might go away soon (winds might presume), but then we can make this the platform to initiate march each year and let them know we take it very seriously.\n\nThis could be one of my rants. But I hope it does turn into something. Maybe ignite someone stronger than me who can take the charge.\n\nClear action/outcome:\n\nIf support turns, I hope to march each day, and further hope others start piling up, till we make the impact. We will need loads of help (for staters reaching to conclusion together on a clear objective of the protest, such as a govt investigation or action plan etc.).
