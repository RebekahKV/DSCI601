Read and inform yourself on the matter instead of scrolling on your phones 24x7. Protests are supposed to be inconvenient. That's what make them effective. And with the mainstream media bootlicking the government, harsh majors have to be taken by the citizens who have some demands from the government. \n\nGerman farmers also protested just recently and thousands of tractors entered central Berlin which obstructed the traffic. And even though Germany is not the *mother of democracy,* the Chancellor Olaf Scholz appealed to the general public to stay calm and not hold grudge towards the protesting farmers instead of blocking the roads, digging highways and laying barbed wires to stop the farmers outside the capital city.", "score": -4, "created_utc": 1707753685.0, "author": "sqrt-1_1_2_half_6", "id": "kq3gzk6", "is_submitter": false, "parent_id": "t1_kq1zxk4"}, {"body": "don\u2019t use buzzwords you do not understand.

Happy Seeder: It is a tractor-mounted no-till planter for the in-situ management of paddy stubble. \n2. Pusa Bio Decomposer: It is a low-cost microbial bio-enzyme solution that converts crop residue into manure, reportedly in 15-20 days. A day or two after applying the solution, farmers will till and water the fields, which will trigger the accelerated decomposition of the residue.\n3.  Ex-situ management of crop residues: Ex-situ or \u201coff-site\u201d conservation and treatment of crop residue is also effective. It eliminates the leftover crops from the land from its natural habitat. Plus, this process is much more eco-friendly than stubble burning.\u00a0 \n4. Alternate use for paddy stubble: Other innovative yet commercial applications for crop residue include re-using it to make products such as paper and packing materials, treating it as an alternate fuel source to generate energy in cement, sugar or oil factories, and converting it to a pulp for the manufacture of sustainable tableware.\u00a0\n5. 2G Ethanol from Agro Waste: There is a growing demand for renewable fuels to replace fossil-based ones. Notably, grain crops store only half of the energy they capture in the harvestable grain, which offers significant potential to extract energy from the crop residues. Manufacturing second-generation (2G) bio-ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass will support the twin objective of preventing stubble burning and replacing fossil fuels with a cleaner, renewable alternative.\n\n**And many more alternatives were listed but then this post would be too long.

Tractor came around half a century ago. People managed their crop waste, maybe by burning or they had enough labour to help remove it. There were less source of other air pollution so effect of stubble burning was not that prominent. But point is most probably this practice of burning stubble is there for centuries.  \n\nWhy are farmers to be blamed for the practice which they have been doing for centuries? It's part of their agricultural practice to keep their land fertile, so they'll do it.\n\nWhy are we expecting them to be considerate when we ourselves need a bike to get milk from 500m. When we need AC cab instead of public transport to get to our destination. Why should only farmer who is burning their skin in all weather be considerate towards environment? Why can't general population understand their own responsibilities towards environment? Farmers are easy scapegoat, koi chahiye blame krne ko jldi se dhoondho, lo mil gye farmers ab 2 mahine inhe gaali dekr apni responsibility towards environment poori krenge and then vahi saal bhar pollution felayenge. \n\nFarmers ko koi shauk nahi to destroy nature, instead they live in nature and understand its importance better than us city people.

But govt didn't help them to cope up with these demands by providing enough tools to efficiently grow and switch between the crops. They did what they had to do which is super bad for environment, but just like we choose our convenience of car over public transport, they choose their convenience.

This problem didn't start in the last decade, it was there all along but now we are seeing the drastic effect. I bet you that environment will never be a priority of any political party. They will ignore it until the situation is like April 2021. Even then they will just do a patch work, why because these dadaji tauji typs politicians have lived most of their life in fresh air.

And I moved to Delhi around a year ago for eDuCaTiOn. \n\nRight before I was to move to this city, I had to go a through a series of let-downs and mental breakdowns. While it is not possible for me to venture into the details, I certainly faced the lingering pressure of these issues even after I had moved. \n\nDelhi, you saved me. This is not to say that moving to Delhi helped solve everything, but you gave me the opportunity to come across wonderful people who helped me, knowingly or unknowingly, chart a path towards recovery. As goes for most small-town queer Indian citizens, at least some of our issues are intertwined with our sexuality and related issues, such as acceptance, future, and guilt. In Delhi, I found queer networks I could never have come across back home. The Delhi pride parade back in January almost made me cry.\n\nEven if you put aside the gay angle, Delhi, your people are unpredictable, just like your food. Not all are kind, and some are outright evil, but others have left a mark on my conscience. Your people are unforgettable. Your food has made me sick more often than I would like to admit, but the day I stop running that risk, kill me. I am convinced some generous human being had paid penance for the Delhi metro to come into existence. It is the biggest blessing this city has received. You are truly a haven for students who move here for self-discovery. YOU ARE CERTAINLY NOT AFFORDABLE, but I love you.\n\nIndia Gate is serene; Sundar Nursery is the love of my life; and Sarojini is where I fight for my life. By no means am I claiming that Delhi is perfect and I am completely sorted, but it is so much better than what would have happened to me in Punjab.\n\nI made the decision to move reluctantly. But three years from now when I receive my degree, I am not going back. Deal with me, Delhi.   \n\\#I am not sure whether I am using the correct flair or not.

So I just spent some time going over a British Era Gazette from 1885, and other sources. Had some cool remarks on how they perceived Delhi's moody weather.\n\n1. Winters were thought to be much like the rest of Punjab, but in Delhi the cool season ended a fortnight before Lahore (Delhi was in Punjab State till they made it the capital)\n2. 1st April was the date from which tents became uncomfortable to stay in. Pankhas (the hand-operated ones run by servants) stayed on from 1st April to 1st October\n3. A violent Loo wind during Jeth (Jyeshth month, till early-mid June) ruined crops, but the east wind was seen as bad for health and the monsoons\n4. Ashadh, Shravan, Bhadon (Bhadrapada) and Asoj (Ashwin) were the rainy season, called chaumansa. From early Asoj onwards (late September), if the West wind blows the weather is healthy, else people get boils and fevers\n5. October-November was called the fever season, with great mortality in the rural parts of Delhi. Especially the Western Yamuna Canal area. We now know this is Malaria and Dengue, whos mosquito origins were only discovered in 1897\n6. Winter rain is preferred since it makes ploughing easy. Post the rainy spells, temperatures drop and a bleak North-West wind makes it seems much colder than it is (hard relate rn)\n7. Delhi rains were notoriously fickle back then too\n\n* 1884-85 record - 1219.2 mms \n* 1896-97 record - 5.1 mms (at Mehrauli)\n\n(Consider that Delhi's average is 650 mms or so)\n\nSource - Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, Delhi District Gazetteer 1883-84", "score": 45, "created_utc": 1706870059.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/1ah0qgx/random_delhi_weather_facts_and_history/", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 6, "comments": [{"body": "Omg this is AWESOME!!

During my first winter, I smelt a very strong fragrance in the air which was somehow similar to ripe cardamom (as I vaguely remember from my one time encounter with ripe cardamom during childhood ). I thought some mobile vendor was around the colony, selling ripe cardamom. In the next few winters I had the same experience over and over again. On one occasion I even stumbled upon the fallen flower responsible for the fragrance (and thus realized that it is not the smell of ripe cardamom) but even then my brain never recognized the connection between the time of the year and the fragrance. In 2021 while I was passing through Defence Colony in South Delhi, I got the smell again and it suddenly struck me, \"Wait! I get this smell every year just when winter is approaching\". I asked the cab driver if he recognized the smell and whether this flower blooms only during the advent of winter. He had no clue. Few days ago, I got the smell again. This time, I went around asking my colleagues and friends who were born and brought up in Delhi. All of them are clueless. In other words, none of them has been able to identify the pattern... \"Smell Come, Winter come\". So, just a while ago I did a Google search \"Delhi winter fragrance\" and read an article on Indian Express, attributing the fragrance to saptaparni tree. The next search result was this reddit post. I Googled images of the tree and showed it to my colleagues and all of them are able to identify it, although they are still oblivious to its connection with the advent of winter. The admin officer said to me,\"mere ko toh aisa kabhi mehsus nahin  hua. Leken agar aapko mehsus hua, toh aapka dimaag bariya hai\". I feel smart, and thus, happy lol!\n\nNB: Speaking from experience, do not smell the flower up close.

Heck small town doctors tell seniors to stay indoors on Diwali night. Even before all this, Indian media gave the industry a fair bit of scrutiny because of child labour in Sivakasi and the number of children who used to die in those sweatshops every year. Media awareness worked and TN government got child labour under control. The era of cheap crackers was over but this was generally seen as a good thing. Solutions can happen when people stop raging against imagined straw men.\n\nEnvironmental science research and activism was behind the court orders that led to first solution that was implemented to combat air pollution in Delhi, the shut down and cancellation of further expansion at the Badarpur coal-fired power station. Other big policy moves led to Delhi having a large share of CNG vehicles in public transit and cabs.
