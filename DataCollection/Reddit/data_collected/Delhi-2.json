If you search for its effects on people on Google, it will indicate that exposure is comparable to smoking over 50 cigarettes and can lead to asthma, heart disease, leukemia (blood cancer), and lung cancer. If doctors' and Google's statements are accurate, I'm uncertain how many people may develop such diseases. Looking for solutions suggests staying indoors and going outside only when essential, with the use of original N99 masks. However, not everyone can remain confined to their homes for extended periods, and obtaining and affording original masks is a challenge for many. Consequently, the dilemma arises \u2013 should we venture outside and inhale toxic air? I find it puzzling that if this is a significant threat, why isn't the government taking effective action?

And I'm super anxious about the pollution wave that will inevitably come with the cold winds.\n\nIn my honest opinion, a lot of people don't bother about something that does not causes issues to people immediately.  Same goes in the case of pollution, a lot of people aren't bothered about the pollution much. They're fine breathing it directly disregarding the long term damage that the pollution is doing (I'm no expert on how much the damage it will do, but I'm pretty sure that it could cause issues to a person in someway. Long-term exposure to polluted air can have permanent health effects such as: Accelerated aging of the lungs. Loss of lung capacity and decreased lung function.)\n\nSo with this post, I wanted to seek help from the people of Delhi about the ways for avoiding air pollution and keeping yourself safe. People might argue that post-covid everyone is aware of n95 masks so just wear them, but I'm concerned about the efficiency of those masks to block the air pollution. The seal around the face of an N95 mask/respirator is NOT completely airtight when it is properly fitted and seated. There is always some area where the air can leak (Naturally, matters takes the path of least resistance, so the amount of polluted air intake would be significantly greater than that of the filtered air.)  \n\n\nWith all that, It makes me wonder if someone have found an economical and an efficient way of curbing the air pollution in Delhi.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1697537748.0, "permalink": "/r/delhi/comments/179v14g/aqi_in_delhi_a_discussion_about_the_air_pollution/", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 6, "comments": [{"body": "Hey OP... I can point you towards the best resources to answer this question. There is a team of scientists from IIT-Delhi and AIIMS Delhi called as CAPHER India. You can follow them and their research work.

While Dr. Sagnik Dey is not a medical doctor, he has also worked a lot in this area.   \nI'll enumerate the measures which have been advised by the stalwarts:-  \n1. Stay indoors during early morning and late evening (Moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation),\n\n2. Cleaning of indoor air (Air purifiers have Low quality evidence, weak recommendation; HEPA filters have moderate quality of evidence and strong recommendation) \n\n3. Avoid vigorous and extended outdoor activity during peaks of air pollution (low quality of evidence,  weak recommendation). Breath through nose as much as possible.  \n4. Avoid environments near main roads and traffic. Avoid travelling by road, use metro instead (No evidence, weak recommendation)  \n5. Wearing of masks :- properly fitting N99 respirators with filters changed in adequate intervals are the best, N95 which are fitting properly and not drenched in sweat are also okay (moderate evidence, strong recommendation)  \n6. Effective medical management of Asthma, COPD and heart disease to reduce individual susceptibility in those suffering from these diseases (High quality evidence, strong recommendation)  \n\n\nI have tried to compile the list of personal interventions.

I think what has happened is that citizen activism is pretty much dead in Delhi. There are three possible reasons:\n\n1. Many activists got co-opted by AAP and Delhi govt. They are now vela volunteers doing useless shit like holding placards at intersections.\n\n2. NGOs are starved for funding because of ego of some people who think 2ab is magic.\n\n3. After CAA and Shaheen Bagh protests there was a crackdown on basically any and every kind of activist. Delhi has always been the epicenter of major protests that resulted in on ground changes. Think Nirbhaya, Lokpal, Jessica Lal, OROP etc. \n\nPolice lathicharge, water canons, arrests were there in previous protests also. But there was also an understanding that non violent protest is ok, and if people are not happy with something then it is the government's duty to engage with the people. This is why you never hear of some one being imprisoned for Lokpal protest for 3 years, or someone being charged for sedition for saying that India is unsafe for women at Nirbhaya protests.\n\nBut what did this government do. They imprisoned educated people who were protesting non violently. They allowed goons to assault and open fire in peaceful protestors and then celebrated them. They let police go full Israeli mode and assault everyone. It's not like they went after only Jamia/JNU students or muslims. They also targeted Hindus and basically anyone with more than two brain cells.\n\nEarlier student protestors used to have some backing from both opposition and ruling parties and elites. Basically a kind of alumni and support system where prominent lawyers would fight for students and politicians would use their influence to protect the students and activists from police excesses. Now that INC is almost non existent in Delhi, this support is gone. AAP has zero interest in backing protestors. They are happy that protestors were repressed because it's one less problem for them.\n\nSo now if you are an educated middle class person upset with pollution what do you do? Probably too scared to organise a protest. Even if you organize one others are afraid to come.

But I seriously think that we've reached the point of no return. I mean yes, the crop burning is a major contributor to the bad AQI. But so is the amount of construction, cars on road and other such activities. \n\nI speak from the perspective of a cyclist. I bike on a daily basis and would gladly commute by a cycle or walk or take the metro. But after a 100K ride in the shitty air, I developed a bad cold and can't manage to get back on my cycle. And I can't ride in the afternoon/evening hours either because of the insane amount of traffic since every Tom, Dick and Harry feel the need to buy an Innova or Thar or Fortuner just to transport a single person. For fuck's sake if you go 30KMs in any direction from Central Delhi, you'll be out of Delhi. That's how small this place is. We have an amazing metro infra. Why do people still need two cars in every household? \n\nThe issue is that we can't stop this. Clearly the government, no matter which party leads it, has been bought out by the car and construction industry, who want it to keep on engaging in worthless construction. Why can't we spend more on strengthening the current public transport system and reducing the amount of traffic on roads instead of building highways and bypasses which will also get clogged up soon due to the amount of cars on road?  \n\nBut then haven't we already gone too far? We can't take down all the empty, dead high rises and malls in places like Gurgaon. We can't demolish all the highways and make all the cars disappear. We were never meant to go down this path but we did. And now there's no going back. The AQI will keep getting worse. The water will keep getting dirtier... Yamuna is already full of crap no matter how much we talk about cleaning it. It sounds pessimistic but I don't think we're going to be able to change anything now. We've pretty much reached the point of no return. And it'll just be worse for our kids.

Atleast the environmental impact of that is lower than building highways and then cars running along on them.

Wearing N95 mask is more or less mandatory for people like me along with inhaler and a bunch of medications. Near my apartent, it smells all the time like someone has just burst crackers.  And I have to request uber drivers to pull the windows up everytime and some of them leave gaps in the window so I have to request them a few more times. As per doctors, being out in the open in these winter months is like smoking packs of cigarettes. Asthma, bronchitis, even cancer in the long term are on the rise. How are people living like this, inhaling poison everyday. The permissible AQI is 100 if I am not wrong, what the hell is 500? It is just ridiculous. Most of the population either don't care or have gotten used to it (\"thik hai chalta hai, itna ro mat etc.\"). The government pretends to do something about it but doesn't do anything effective. And why should it care if most people are okay with living like this. On a lighter note, our CM has to attend ED summons due to the liquor scam case, and his right hand is in jail. I don't think this is a very difficult problem to solve and there are many capable people in the country/government who can find a solution. But somehow we are okay with - thik hai chalne do...

The city of Delhi, known for grappling with some of the worst air pollution levels globally, is taking drastic measures to curb the environmental crisis they're facing. The local authorities recently declared a one-week closure of schools and a four-day halt on construction activities to protect citizens from the worsening levels of toxic smog. Additionally, government offices and private businesses have been encouraged to adopt work-from-home arrangements.\n\nWhat caught my eye, in particular, was the discussion around a potential \"**Pollution Lockdown**.\" The idea was suggested by the Supreme Court of India, and the Delhi government, led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), expressed its readiness to implement such a lockdown if necessary. This proposal is seen as an \"extreme step\" by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal but is being considered to safeguard public health. However, it's interesting to note that the federal government opposes this plan, showcasing a divergence in approaches towards managing the pollution crisis between local and federal authorities.\n\nThe notion of a pollution lockdown is quite novel and could set a precedent for other heavily polluted cities across the globe. It brings up several discussion points:\n\n1. What are your thoughts on the concept of a Pollution Lockdown? Is it a viable solution to severe air pollution crises in urban areas?\n2. How might such a lockdown impact the economy and daily life in Delhi and potentially in other cities facing similar issues?\n3. What other measures could be more effective or should be implemented alongside to address the root causes of air pollution?\n4. How does the opposition from the federal government play into the dynamics of environmental governance in India?\n\nI'm keen to hear your insights and engage in a fruitful discussion on this topical issue.

Stubble burning around delhi contributes to about 20-30 microgram of on 2.5 per cubic metre , but this effect is there for about a month 4 times an year. Pm 2.5 due to stubble burning is composed mainly of black carbon. Firecrackers are markedly different. They contribute to upto 600 microgram of pm 2.5 per cubic metre, but it remains on the atmosphere for only about 36 hours... It starts declining and reaches around 20 microgram per cubic metre by a month. Baseline was not very visible.\r  \n\r  \nAn alarming finding was that pm 2.5 due to firecrackers was composed mainly of heavy metals, which are toxic to both humans and environment.
