Punjab govt since 2014 introduced a policy to limit the ground water consumption so they wanted farmers to plant seeds at a certain time. That leaves a small window to get rid of rice straw. Now this was not a concern before as the rice straw would naturally decompose.  You think farmers want to burn the crop, nope they too breathe this.  The farmer greed due to MSP and habit is causing them to grow rice, which we have in excess and each kg of rice needs 500+ L of water.  Now the machines to cut the straw are expensive and not all available at the time of harvest so they burn the crop.  Punjab needs to grow other crops, rice is simply not suitable for this area due to its high water requirements.  The govt made a terrible, corporation motivated attempt without any real alternatives and sudden change with no talks with farmers, so it failed. Adding the political backlash with the deaths and lack of empathy from the centre.  Parali is a water issue of Punjab.  Solutions  1. Tax rice so its not worth growing. Or cancel msp but with alternatives. 2. Clear MSP much higher for oil seeds which are currently imported. 3. Dialog with farmers. 4. Lottery system to who gets to grow rice. 5. Machines that can cut and bale the straw plus fermenting additives for faster natural degradation. 6. Water table recharge. 7. Grow paddy in other area. 8.

I thought some mobile vendor was around the colony, selling ripe cardamom. In the next few winters I had the same experience over and over again. On one occasion I even stumbled upon the fallen flower responsible for the fragrance (and thus realized that it is not the smell of ripe cardamom) but even then my brain never recognized the connection between the time of the year and the fragrance. In 2021 while I was passing through Defence Colony in South Delhi, I got the smell again and it suddenly struck me, \"Wait! I get this smell every year just when winter is approaching\". I asked the cab driver if he recognized the smell and whether this flower blooms only during the advent of winter. He had no clue. Few days ago, I got the smell again. This time, I went around asking my colleagues and friends who were born and brought up in Delhi. All of them are clueless. In other words, none of them has been able to identify the pattern... \"Smell Come, Winter come\". So, just a while ago I did a Google search \"Delhi winter fragrance\" and read an article on Indian Express, attributing the fragrance to saptaparni tree. The next search result was this reddit post. I Googled images of the tree and showed it to my colleagues and all of them are able to identify it, although they are still oblivious to its connection with the advent of winter. The admin officer said to me,\"mere ko toh aisa kabhi mehsus nahin  hua. Leken agar aapko mehsus hua, toh aapka dimaag bariya hai\". I feel smart, and thus, happy lol!

So the solution to that is :-    1)To use more public transport.  2) Or if you still want to use your car then try to give lift to your office colleagues so that amount of vehicles could be reduced.  3) And also make WFH a choice for an employee.
